Additionally, various store atmospheric elements were utilised in the design of the user interface. The resulting solution was successfully launched and was able to attract eight customers who leased a store within the mall. Furthermore, the mall was visited by 145 users within the first three weeks following the launch. \n",

    "    “The metaverse is here, and it’s not only transforming how we see the world but how we participate in it“ (Nadella, 2021). Whether one counts themselves as an avid follower of emerging technologies or not, it is safe to say that the term “metaverse” has reached mainstream audiences and has had a polarising effect on consumers and businesses alike. With companies such as Facebook renaming themselves to Meta (cf. Meta, 2021) and seemingly betting the company’s entire future on the success of the metaverse, the interest and hype surrounding this emerging technology has seen a meteoric rise throughout the past years. However, with companies racing to integrate the metaverse into their strategy, there appears to be a considerable amount of scepticism and confusion surrounding the topic. Searching the term on Google, one will quickly find an abundance of articles with titles that go along the lines of “What exactly is the metaverse?”. While consumers seem to be confused by the concept, others even interpret current metaverse developments as a mere fad at best and see it as the newest marketing buzzword (cf. Musk, 2021). The confusion and scepticism surrounding the metaverse seems to stem from the general vagueness about basic facts such as what the metaverse is, what it will offer, and when it will arrive. As there is currently no universally accepted definition of what a metaverse is and the fact that the metaverse is used as an umbrella term combining various technologies such as blockchains, virtual reality, digital twins, artificial intelligence and more, it is currently hard to classify what is and what is not a metaverse as well as what use cases it will have. While these points are criticised, metaverse advocates often argue that they are a normal part of the development of major technological innovations and will often point to the initial vagueness and scepticism surrounding the internet in its early days. No matter what side of the debate one is on, the metaverse promises to provide consumers and companies with new and exciting possibilities in numerous industries. While looking at various use cases, this thesis will mainly explore the metaverses' potential as a platform for creating immersive shopping and advertising experiences. As consumer commerce has increasingly shifted from traditional brick-and-mortar businesses to e-commerce in the past decade, the metaverse offers businesses yet another possibility to reach their customers online, while providing them with a 3D experience that is more akin to a physical store than a two-dimensional website. This thesis will analyse the current state of this field of study and show a practical example of how metaverse shopping experiences can be implemented.\n",

    "    As the amount of data grows and competition increases, companies are becoming ever more interested in leveraging external data sources to drive their decision-making and gain a competitive edge. The incorporation of external data is not new to the world of business intelligence and data warehousing, but the drastic increase in available data over the last decade has led to a renewed interest in the topic. While a lot of good ideas and general excitement can be found in articles and online posts, the external data topic remains rather unexplored within academic circles and is often treated as a side topic. This project thesis describes the process of finding, integrating and using external data relevant to the financial services industry. Following this process, this thesis tries to answer how external data can be used alongside internal data to support the decision-making and reporting process, while also examining which types of insights the data can offer and how data needs to be processed in order to be integrated into the data warehouse. Throughout the process, various data sources were examined including those paid and publicly available that offered relevant data sets. These data sets were combined with matching internal data to create multiple reports. Additionally, automated workflows using the Knime Analytical Platform and Python were used to integrate the data in the data warehouse. While a lot of payment relevant data is locked behind paywalls, multiple free and trusted sources could be identified and used. Resulting reports primarily offer descriptive but also predictive insights which give decision makers an outside perspective. Furthermore, achieving a high degree of automation for the integration process was key in minimizing the time spent on data integration and maintaining a high degree of data quality.\n",
