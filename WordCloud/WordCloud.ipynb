      "126076 With the use of virtual worlds becoming a growing trend, the metaverse is becoming a promising channel for Brands to offer their customers immersive shopping experiences. While virtual interactive worlds are nothing new and have been utilised for purposes such as video games for almost 50 years, an increasing number of brands and platforms are offering open-ended virtual experiences which are marketed under the term metaverse. The meteoric rise of this new virtual channel has prompted many researchers to study this emerging field to clear up the vagueness surrounding the topic. However, at present the academic literature is still struggling to define the boundaries of what is and what is not a metaverse. Meanwhile, other research focuses on the commercial applications of the metaverse, with the intent of translating existing consumer behaviour research on store atmospherics and layouts, from traditional channels to the domain of virtual commerce. While many brands are interested in utilising this new channel, creating them comes with several challenges and uncertainties as many companies lack experience within this field. This thesis tries to shed light on the process associated with building a virtual shopping experience by following the process of developing a white-label shopping mall solution to offer brands easy access to the metaverse through customizable store spaces. The scope of this research included the initial requirements analysis, followed by the implementation, and launch of the solution. Throughout the development process, multiple requirements such as resource management, modular design, and payment integration were identified and implemented. Additionally, various store atmospheric elements were utilised in the design of the user interface. The resulting solution was successfully launched and was able to attract eight customers who leased a store within the mall. Furthermore, the mall was visited by 145 users within the first three weeks following the launch.\n",
      "“The metaverse is here, and it’s not only transforming how we see the world but how we participate in it“ . Whether one counts themselves as an avid follower of emerging technologies or not, it is safe to say that the term “metaverse” has reached mainstream audiences and has had a polarising effect on consumers and businesses alike. With companies such as Facebook renaming themselves to Meta  and seemingly betting the company’s entire future on the success of the metaverse, the interest and hype surrounding this emerging technology has seen a meteoric rise throughout the past years. However, with companies racing to integrate the metaverse into their strategy, there appears to be a considerable amount of scepticism and confusion surrounding the topic. Searching the term on Google, one will quickly find an abundance of articles with titles that go along the lines of “What exactly is the metaverse?”. While consumers seem to be confused by the concept, others even interpret current metaverse developments as a mere fad at best and see it as the newest marketing buzzword . The confusion and scepticism surrounding the metaverse seems to stem from the general vagueness about basic facts such as what the metaverse is, what it will offer, and when it will arrive. As there is currently no universally accepted definition of what a metaverse is and the fact that the metaverse is used as an umbrella term combining various technologies such as blockchains, virtual reality, digital twins, artificial intelligence and more, it is currently hard to classify what is and what is not a metaverse as well as what use cases it will have. While these points are criticised, metaverse advocates often argue that they are a normal part of the development of major technological innovations and will often point to the initial vagueness and scepticism surrounding the internet in its early days. No matter what side of the debate one is on, the metaverse promises to provide consumers and companies with new and exciting possibilities in numerous industries. While looking at various use cases, this thesis will mainly explore the metaverses' potential as a platform for creating immersive shopping and advertising experiences. As consumer commerce has increasingly shifted from traditional brick-and-mortar businesses to e-commerce in the past decade, the metaverse offers businesses yet another possibility to reach their customers online, while providing them with a 3D experience that is more akin to a physical store than a two-dimensional website. This thesis will analyse the current state of this field of study and show a practical example of how metaverse shopping experiences can be implemented.   With the emergence of the metaverse as a new digital channel, more and more companies are looking at ways to take their brands into the metaverse and offer consumers an immersive digital shopping experience. As such, this thesis will explore how companies can leverage metaverse platforms to create 3D shopping spaces and experiences for consumers. To examine the possibilities the metaverse offers, the research question will be examined from both a theoretical as well a practical point of view. Firstly, to establish some theoretical groundwork and clear up possible confusion surrounding the metaverse, a literature review will be conducted. The reviewed literature will be used to explain some of the basic metaverse concepts and technologies and cover the platforms that offer metaverse experiences today. Additionally, the review will take a close look at the type of shopping experiences the metaverse can offer, what types of experiences are already available, and which factors impact these. Lastly, as the basis for the practical part of this thesis, the review will cover various aspects related to the development process of 3D spaces within the metaverse. The literature review will be followed by the main part, which will be practical and will follow the implementation of a white-label metaverse solution at the company Worldline. This section will explain various aspects of the solution but will mainly concentrate on the technical implementation of the solution and cover how the defined requirements were implemented, what challenges were faced and how these were met. Lastly, the development process and the resulting solution will be analysed and critically assessed before concluding the thesis.Seeing as the metaverse is a subject that is still new to many people, this literature review will start by examining some of the basic questions such as what the metaverse is, how it works, as well as the type of applications it can be used for. Additionally, some key concepts and terms will be explained and defined using opinions from various academic sources. With these basics covered, the review will focus on the shopping/commerce use case of the metaverse and analyse the metaverse's role as a sales channel and determine which factors influence the consumer’s experience. Lastly, this section will end by reviewing several options for developing on metaverse platforms and going through some of the key concepts related to the development of virtual worlds.While the idea of a metaverse might seem very new and advanced to most people, the concepts and ideas behind the metaverse have existed for far longer than most would believe. The metaverses' first mention can be dated back to the year 1992 when the term was coined by science fiction author Neal Stephenson in his book Snow Crash. The book describes a dystopian future in which humanity spends much of its time in a virtual world referred to as the metaverse, which is accessed through the use of virtual reality devices and where people, in the form of avatars, seek entertainment and do many of the things they would (like to) do in the physical world . While there currently exists no universally accepted definition of what the metaverse is, different academic sources generally agree, that at a basic level, the metaverse is a three-dimensional virtual world, in which users are able to interact with each other . The development of virtual spaces and worlds, in which users can spend their time can be traced back to the 1970s and has been heavily influenced by the gaming industry as well as various works of science fiction . The development has since gone through many stages and has led to the release of the first commercial virtual worlds such as Second Life, which was released in 2003 . Since these early days, more and more virtual world platforms have been released and have found mainstream success, with modern platforms such as Roblox seeing 150 million monthly active users (MAU) entering their virtual spaces . As with previous advances in the field, new technological concepts and advances have been the main driving force behind these new platforms and the increased interest in them. Today’s virtual worlds are built on state-of-the-art technologies from various domains such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchains, virtual & augmented reality, edge computing, digital twins etc., that are gradually forming these platforms into the metaverse as envisioned in various works of science fiction . It is also these advancements in technology that have led to the metaverse gaining mainstream appeal. While virtual spaces were for a long time considered as places for younger cohorts to play video games, recent advances have led many industries to consider how they can leverage the metaverse for their business model. It is now believed that all major industries such as “health care, consumer products, entertainment and business-to-business technical solutions to payments”  will in some way be influenced by the metaverse. The domain of virtual commerce has been at the forefront of the commercialization of virtual worlds. Apparel companies like Nike and Gucci as well as other luxury fashion brands, have shown big interest in the metaverse and have established a presence in various virtual world platforms, where they promote their brand and sell physical but also purely digital versions of their products . Various sources attribute the growing interest in virtual spaces, not just for entertainment but also for numerous commercial purposes, at least partially, to the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led many to flee into the virtual world to find some source of human interaction while they were forced to stay within the confines of their homes . However, while companies try to leverage the metaverse and the excitement surrounding it is ever-growing, it is important to remember that the metaverse remains without a clear definition. Additionally, most platforms today that refer to themselves as “The Metaverse”, do not meet the proposed criteria that many metaverse researchers have laid out for a complete metaverse, mainly the aspect of interoperability or interconnectedness . As such, there remains a lot of confusion about the metaverse.As mentioned in the section above, academic literature currently does not offer an agreed upon definition of what a metaverse is . The lack of a proper definition for the metaverse is seen as problematic and even harmful to its future development  and has led to a division between those that believe the metaverse to be a technology of the future, not yet achieved, and those that believe that current solutions already satisfy the requirements of a metaverse . However, while the metaverse remains undefined, the number of competing definitions i growing quickly. Finding a suitable definition has been the main topic of numerous metaverse research papers  and has led to many papers starting with the author coining their definition or aligning with another researcher’s definition for the sake of clarity.  Table 1 showcases five metaverse definitions from research papers used as part of this literature review. While some of these definitions mention various technologies such as AR and VR as part of their definition , the common denominator between each is that they define the metaverse as being a virtual world. Although this is seemingly the most widely accepted fact about the metaverse, it is also the root of many divergent opinions, particularly regarding whether the metaverse has already been achieved. If the metaverse is a virtual world, what characteristics make it different from just being a virtual world? Virtual worlds are defined by  as “Virtual worlds are persistent online computer-generated environments where multiple users in remote physical locations can interact in real-time for the purposes of work or play” . The development of virtual worlds precedes the metaverse and can be traced back to the creation of multi-user dungeons (MUD) in the 1970s. Since then, the development of virtual worlds has been categorised into five distinct phases starting from the 1970s and leading up to the present day . The five phases of development were characterised by a constant advance in computational power, culminating in the first commercially used virtual worlds such as Second Life, which was released in 2003 by Linden Lab and had developed an in-game economy valued at USD 500 million by the year 2015 . Additionally, the development was characterised by a constant shift, which saw virtual worlds move away from their initial focus on gaming, characterised by worlds offering predefined goals, activities, and a linear experience to spaces more akin to the real world, that offer little to no predefined activities, rely mainly on user-generated content (UGC) and offer an open-ended experience . Although the scope of virtual worlds is now far greater than just gaming, it is interesting to note that its influence can still be seen in the terminology used when discussing them. Whereas regular online platforms refer to their customers as users, virtual worlds have players who are playing, while the user experience and activities are referred to as the gameplay . Current metaverse developments fall into the fifth phase of virtual world development, which mark the transition from virtual worlds to the metaverse. While there is not a clear consensus of what aspects will characterise this transition, many researchers see the aspects of interoperability and blended reality to be the central innovations that the metaverse will bring to virtual worlds . Interoperability, often also called interconnectedness, refers to the move from single virtual spaces to connected virtual worlds between which players and assets can move without restrictions or loss of data. Dionisio et al.  describe this development as a succession of states that transition from single virtual worlds, referred to as MetaWorlds, to MetaGalaxies, which combine multiple virtual worlds under a single authority, to a complete metaverse combining both MetaWorlds and Galaxies as part of a decentralised network using standard protocols to allow complete interoperability. Even though the aspect of interoperability is mostly accepted, other researchers see the combination of the physical and virtual worlds as the main metaverse drivers. Such views focus heavily on the interfaces used to interact with the metaverse, such as VR and AR. Dwivedi et al. go as far as saying “any metaverse cannot exist without AR and/or VR” , which disqualifies many of the current virtual worlds as being a metaverse. However, even though AR and VR are often quoted as being central building blocks of the metaverse , other researchers don’t see these technologies as being mandatory . Overall, as the hype surrounding the metaverse grows, certain aspects of the metaverse remain unclear, with researchers taking different stances on which aspects will be part of the metaverse and which will not. As new metaverse platforms emerge, the need for a clear-cut definition is becoming increasingly urgent.Although researchers cannot yet agree on an exact definition, this has not kept them from discussing what the metaverse of the future will look like and which innovations will pave the way. With the metaverse set to bring innovations and new possibilities to almost every industry , it should not come as a surprise that the technology stack, on which the metaverse is built, is rather complex. Current research tries to establish an architecture for the metaverse, which has resulted in the creation of several models that try to organise individual building blocks logically. This section will be used to review approaches found in current research and evaluate how these compare to each other. Additionally, some of the core technologies will be highlighted to clarify their application within the metaverses technology stack.The metaverse connects many of today’s cutting-edge technologies and has thus turned into an interdisciplinary topic . Trying to create a more holistic view of the metaverse, various research papers try to organise technological, as well as non-technological dimensions, into a single structure. Such structures are generally referred to as “architectures”, “Layers” or “Components” of the metaverse. While these models don’t align perfectly with each other, most of them propose a layered structure. .  propose a thorough model which not only defines distinct layers but also maps the relevant technologies. For the metaverse to be fully realised it will rely on various technologies and will have to consider different aspects of the metaverse ecosystem. Lee et al. organise these factors into 14 focus areas that will support the creation and usage of the metaverse. As Figure 1 shows, the proposed structure defines a technology and ecosystem layer, which groups elements, starting with fundamental building blocks such as infrastructure and avatars, and continuous with the technologies and ecosystem aspects that build on top of these . The model is in essence a roadmap for the metaverse, showing the technological innovations the metaverse requires from the technological perspective, and open decisions about how to handle various aspects of the metaverse ecosystem .Other researchers have opted for similar layered approaches but have put less emphasis on the concrete technologies that these contain. Duan et al. propose a similar layered architecture, which places components in an infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem layer. This approach focuses on the convergence of the physical and virtual world, with the infrastructure and ecosystem layer containing components that are purely physical or digital respectively, while the intersection layer contains elements such as digital twins and content creation interfaces, that create the connection between the physical and digital world . Similarly, there have been attempts to use the OSI reference model as the basis for a standardised metaverse model. This approach sees the data flow and application layers, defined by the OSI model, adapted into the infrastructure layer, made up of the device, communication, cloud, and virtual cloud layer and the metaverse layer containing the data space, digital twin and perception layers. The authors claim that having decoupled layers, as with the OSI reference model, will give each layer more freedom in its development . As mentioned before, there is currently no standardised model or architecture for the metaverse , however, the proposed models mentioned above show many similarities. While each model differs to some degree, researchers seem to agree on a layered approach, which tries to separate physical from virtual factors and sees computing and network infrastructure as its fundamental building blocks. As figure 1 shows, the metaverse is built on top of many of today’s most innovative technologies. This section will offer a short overview of the main technologies that are part of the metaverse technology stack and explain how these are driving metaverse development as well as their current limitations.Game Engines: As the metaverse will be a (or many) virtual world(s) at its core, game engines are an essential part of the creation process. Game engines have traditionally been used in the development of video games. They are essentially a platform or framework in which developers can create virtual spaces without having to implement basic features from the ground up . Basic features include graphics rendering, physics engines, lighting systems and collision detection, which are required for almost any virtual world. By offering these fundamental pieces, developers are able to dedicate more time to creating actual features, that will improve their product . While big game developers typically build their own in-house game engines, the majority of today’s video games are developed on pre-built engines. The market for such pre-built solutions is dominated by the open-source solution Unity, developed by Unity Technologies and the Unreal engine by Epic Games . With the increased demand for virtual space in industries such as manufacturing, public planning and the film industry, these platforms have found new use cases that go well beyond the creation of video games and which have turned Unity Technologies and Epic Games into influential players within the metaverse space as they offer the platforms used to create these virtual spaces . Virtual and Augmented Reality: Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are believed to be the primary interface through which users experience the metaverse . Both technologies represent two separate ends of the so-called Reality-Virtuality Continuum. Immersing oneself in VR or AR requires the use of a headset or head-mounted display. In the case of VR, the user is blocked off from the outside world and fully immersed inside the virtual space. AR, on the other hand, overlays virtual assets onto the physical world, letting the user experience the real world through a see-through display. Both VR and AR are part of the greater Extended Reality (XR) family, which also includes Mixed Reality, a mix between AR and VR, which is however not clearly defined as of yet. . The immersive potential that VR and AR offer can be applied for use cases such as simulations, gaming, work, marketing, and education  However, while these technologies are very promising, they still have to overcome some technological challenges. These challenges primarily pertain to the limited field of view (FOV) and resolutions that current headsets provide. To give users the impression of full immersion, VR headsets have to mimic the human visual range, which requires a FOV of 200° x 130°. While current displays can get close to this visual range, it requires the use of displays with at least 6K horizontal resolution, making such headsets extremely expensive . Additionally, there is the problem of motion sickness, which is a phenomenon many users experience while using VR headsets that causes feelings of nausea and dizziness. Even though this side effect is well known, current research has not been able to find its exact cause .Blockchain: Blockchain is a ledger technology that stores data in virtual blocks. Each block of data references the previous and next block thus creating a link of blocks referred to as a chain. This data structure is stored on all nodes participating in the blockchain network, making the network completely decentralised. Additionally, a new block can only be added through a so-called consensus algorithm, which forces all nodes to agree on the validity of a newly added block . In combination, these techniques lead to a system that is almost impossible to manipulate or control, while remaining completely decentralised . Blockchain was first introduced through the Bitcoin Network but has since found multiple new use cases. State-of-the-art blockchains such as Ethereum are not just able to manage digital payments, but can also store code, making it possible to deploy decentralised applications, smart contracts and track non-interchangeable digital assets referred to as non-fungible tokens (NFT) . The addition of the latter two concepts has opened the doors for blockchain to be the basis for the virtual economy inside the metaverse, offering the secure tracking of virtual assets through the use of NFTs and the management of transactions through smart contracts , while also providing the basis for decentralised data storage . Current virtual world platforms such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels already use NFTs and smart contracts as a way for players to own and sell virtual land and assets that are immutably tracked by the Ethereum blockchain . Decentraland has even gone a step further and created a Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAO) through the use of smart contracts. This organisation votes on issues including land and estate features, marketplace fees etc., which all community members can participate in . However, the possibilities offered by blockchain technology have also given rise to new debates and concerns. With virtual assets becoming persistent and trackable, questions have emerged about how these assets should be viewed from a legal point of view and whether they count as legal objects . On the technical side, blockchains are still struggling with transaction times. As every transaction has to be validated by the consensus algorithm, the transaction can only be seen as completed once the algorithm is finished and the transaction has been appended to the chain. This does not allow for the typical fast transaction times and more research is required to find ways to speed up the consensus mechanism .Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for all technologies “that enable machines to learn, think and behave like humans do” . State-of-the-art AI techniques include machine learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning, which have numerous applications inside and outside of the metaverse . One of the main use cases for AI inside the metaverse will be controlling non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs are any agent within a virtual world that is not controlled by a human. Such characters are used to interact with users in the form of assistants, enemies, or characters in a story . AI-powered NPCs, which will be trained through customer interactions, will be especially important for the purpose of consumer interactions, offering users unique interactions. Researchers are expecting AI-powered NPCs to play a big role in the metaverse and predict that the majority of interactions will not be human-to-human but human-to-AI . While the potential for AI is very promising, the models on which these applications run are complex and resource intensive, making them unfit for mobile devices .   Edge Computing: Running a virtual world requires a vast amount of computing resources to simulate the world's physics, collisions etc. Older virtual worlds such as Second Life have used centralised servers, often in the cloud, for such computational efforts. With increasing data and computational demand, this approach can limit the number of users in a certain space and cause latency issues . Edge computing is employed as a solution to this problem. It addresses the latency issues by distributing computing resources and data storage closer to the end-user . As latency is one of the primary influences on a user’s sense of immersion, minimising it is extremely important. Mobile devices such as headsets and smartphones, which will be the main gateways into the metaverse, heavily rely on the offloading of computational tasks and will be the main benefactors of edge computing .Although many aspects of the metaverse remain unclear and are still in development, numerous platforms such as Roblox, Decentraland and The Sandbox have emerged, which offer users the possibility of taking part in a shared virtual world. Within the last two years, the number of mobile apps that have added “metaverse” to their description or name has drastically grown . Such platforms often advertise themselves as being part of the metaverse, however, some researchers point out that they do not meet all the criteria to be referred to as such . Without a general definition of the metaverse, it is almost impossible to differentiate, which platforms are part of the metaverse, and which are not. Despite this, there have been attempts to categorise the current metaverse platforms based on various dimensions. The proposed models place platforms into one of four categories based on two or more dimensions . Kshetri proposes a model, which classifies metaverse platforms based on the type of interface they offer and whether their economy is decentralised or not. In terms of the interface, the model distinguishes between 2D and 3D worlds . Two-dimensional virtual spaces are being utilised in platforms such as Gather Town, which specialises in collaboration within virtual spaces , as well as decentralised social games. Meanwhile, the aspect of decentralisation through the use of blockchain technology is much more debated, as some see decentralisation as a foundational feature of the metaverse, while others believe it to be a technology which can be used if needed . Decentralization through blockchains is primarily used in platforms that include a virtual economy. This way secure transactions and ownership can be handled through NFTs and smart contracts. However, not all use cases require blockchain technology. Virtual spaces specializing in the simulation of real-world activities such as education or medical operations put their focus on immersive aspects, often through the use of VR and AR, and do not need virtual economy systems . An alternative classification was created by the non-profit organisation Acceleration Studios as part of their metaverse roadmap. This approach defines two axes, resulting in 4 quadrants, each defining a metaverse category .  The axes defined by the model differentiate whether the utilised technologies result in an external or intimate experience and a simulated or augmented experience. As figure 2 shows the horizontal axis differentiates between intimate experiences, which incorporate the user’s virtual actions into the virtual world, and external experiences, which incorporate actions from the physical world into the digital world . The vertical axis, on the other side, distinguishes whether technology is used to bring virtual assets into the real world or simulate the physical world within the virtual world. The combination of the two axis results in four distinct metaverse types. Augmented Reality Worlds, which add virtual assets to the physical world. Mirror Worlds, simulate aspects of the physical world within a virtual space. Life Logging, in which aspects of the physical world are sent to a virtual space to be tracked. And lastly, Virtual Worlds, offer users a virtual space, completely separate from the physical world in which they can immerse themselves .The following section will focus on the metaverse as a means to create shopping experiences to participate in the newly emerging field of virtual commerce. To provide a holistic overview, the section will begin with the fundamentals of the metaverse sales channels, examine what it offers, and how it compares to other channels, mainly traditional e-commerce. Furthermore, as numerous organisations are looking to create immersive experiences in the metaverse, researchers have been evaluating which factors influence the virtual shopping experience and how virtual spaces should be designed for the optimal experience. The findings of these studies will be explained and compared. Lastly, some of the most notable virtual shopping experiences that are currently available will be showcased. This will serve to show some practical examples, allowing for a comparison of aspects such as offered products, the type of virtual environment, and the virtual world platform the companies have chosen.As users spend an increasing amount of their time in virtual spaces, virtual platforms have seen an increase in transactions between users who sell and buy through such platforms. The act of participating in commerce within virtual worlds is referred to as virtual commerce and is defined as “electronically mediated commercial transactions that originate from an alternate reality technological platform and involve either digitally-generated or real-world products and services” (de Regt and Barnes, 2019, p. 19). This new form of commerce is abbreviated as “v-commerce” by many sources (cf. de Regt and Barnes, p. 20, 2019; cf. Hofman-Kohlmeyer, 2017, p. 176; cf. Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019, p. 475), however, other research also refers to it as metaverse commerce (cf. Lee et al., 2021, p. 34) or VR shopping (cf. Xi and Hamari, 2021, p. 46). The emergence of v-commerce has in great part been enabled by recent advances in immersive technologies such as VR, AR and virtual worlds, that allows for the simulation of immersive virtual spaces (cf. Shen et al., 2021, p. 3). Companies are utilising these technologies to create new virtual channels in which they can demonstrate products, hold events, and interact with their customers to create new products. Users can access these spaces through numerous VR interfaces including, regular PC monitors, smartphones connected to VR headsets, head-mounted displays and more (cf. Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019, p. 476). AR on the other hand, sees usage in try-on style applications, that enables the customer to interact with a virtual version of a product before they buy it and which have become popular within the retail sector (cf. de Regt and Barnes, 2019, pp. 21-22). Additionally, the incorporation of blockchain technologies, such as NFTs has been one of the main factors enabling the market for digital assets. As NFTs make digital assets unique and their quantity can be limited by their creator, their scarcity generates value if demand for them exists. Furthermore, common token standards such as ERC721 have enabled the interoperability of NFTs, which allows them to be transferred between different virtual spaces. The aspect of interoperability is a big departure from traditional virtual assets, which have always been restricted to their particular space (cf. Momtaz, 2022, p. 228). These technological innovations have opened the path for shopping and general commerce within the metaverse. V-commerce as a channel, promises to solve problems related to time and space (cf. Xi and Hamari, 2021, p. 37) and provide new possibilities for creating immersive experiences (cf. de Regt and Barnes, 2019, p. 20), which other digital channels lack (cf. Hofman-Kohlmeyer, 2017, p. 178). Within virtual spaces, store owners can display products without taking up any physical space similar to current e-commerce solutions. However, as opposed to 2D images, customers view products in an immersive manner that is closer to the experience provided by traditional brick-and-mortar stores (cf. Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019, p. 476). Research has shown that the use of engaging virtual spaces can “generate affect, a profound sense of presence and increase other cognitive responses that enhance business performance, such as brand recall, which impact on purchase intention” (cf. Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019, p. 481). At the same time, such spaces offer a much greater degree of accessibility as they are available at all times and from all places (cf. Xi and Hamari, 2021, p. 37). As such the v-commerce sales channel places itself between traditional e-commerce channels and brick-and-mortar stores, combining the convenience that comes with a digital experience while still offering immersion and a sense of presence.At its heart v-commerce is a form of digital commerce. It is thus worthwhile to discuss how it differentiates itself and compares to traditional e-commerce. E-commerce is defined as “the advertising, sales, and distribution of products and services through the Internet network” . Depending on the role of the selling and buying party as either a business, consumer or government, e-commerce can further be divided into types such as Business to Consumer (B2C), Business to Business (B2B), Government to Business (G2B), etc. Utilising the internet as a channel for commerce has allowed businesses to increase their reach and offer customers a service that is available to them at all times. This has allowed businesses to use time more effectively, while also reducing expenses for physical stores. However, e-commerce businesses tend to see a much higher number of refunds, as customers cannot try the product before the purchase . In sum, this leads to e-commerce catering to customers that value convenience over social, and atmospheric aspects as well as younger demographics that are accustomed to the internet . As the metaverse presents another digital channel next to e-commerce, it is natural to question how these channels relate to each other and if they offer competing experiences. Within the v-commerce literature, its relationship to e-commerce is not extensively covered. Some authors see v-commerce as a subset of the greater e-commerce genre, which distinguishes itself from other forms of e-commerce through its virtual interface . The 3D interface and the possibilities it offers, has however led others to see v-commerce as the evolution of e-commerce . While it is not clear how v-commerce should exactly fit into the e-commerce typology, the existing literature has widely covered how the shopping experiences between these two vary. These comparisons mainly focus on the aspects of provided shopping value as well as the use of technology.Shopping experiences can offer various kinds of value to a shopper. The value a shopping experience provides is classified as either a hedonic or utilitarian shopping value. Utilitarian shopping values are non-emotional and are created when the shopping transaction, including the acquisition of information as well as buying the product, is convenient and efficient. In contrast, hedonic shopping value focuses on the emotional value an experience can provide  through “multisensory, fantasy, and emotive aspects of consumption” . Research on shopping values focuses on the relationship between hedonic and utilitarian aspects and their influence on the so-called critical outcome variables. Critical outcome variables include satisfaction with the retailer, word of mouth, re-patronage anticipation and re-patronage intention. Research on these argues that only re-patronage intention is mainly influenced by utilitarian factors, while other outcome variables rely on hedonic values . Comparing the e-commerce and v-commerce shopping experience under these aspects, e-commerce shopping mainly offers utilitarian value as it offers customers the convenience of shopping independent from time and location, while also providing easy-to-access product information such as descriptions and reviews . However, the shopping experience, in terms of excitement and stimulation, is very limited compared to traditional in-store shopping . While still a digital channel, v-commerce provides customers with an experience that is unique and interactive. Thus, it caters to experience-oriented customers that are looking for an interactive shopping experience  that provides hedonic shopping value. The difference in provided shopping value shows that these channels don’t necessarily compete for the same target audience, as consumers looking for a hedonic experience will favour an immersive shop in the metaverse, while customers that prefer a straightforward and efficient shopping transaction, will opt for the traditional two-dimensional website . In this vein, multiple researchers are advocating for companies to pursue a multi- or omnichannel approach. Such an approach would see v-commerce activities being integrated with existing e-commerce structures and ensures that customers are able to choose the experience that offers the shopping value they desire . Going on from the provided shopping value, shopping in virtual spaces further differentiates itself from a technological point of view. In terms of technological differences, the correlation between the technological intensity of an experience and the possibility for co-creation it offers has been a topic of study for researchers. Buhalis et al. suggest that possibilities for co-creation through personalisation, customisation etc., increase with the technological intensity of an experience. Additionally, it is argued that experiences built on the metaverse, VR and AR have a fundamentally different relationship to technology compared to less technology-intense experiences, such as those offered through traditional websites. For the latter technology assists co-creation, while it is a prerequisite for an experience built using virtual technology . With companies showing increasing interest in using the metaverse as a channel to provide immersive shopping experiences, the question of how such experiences can be created is becoming more relevant. While interest in v-commerce is higher than ever, the concept of using virtual worlds for commercial purposes has been tried in various virtual spaces such as Second Life in the mid to late 2000s. As such virtual shopping experiences have been studied by various researchers throughout the last decade. This section will seek to find the factors influencing virtual shopping by evaluating various research results. The reviewed literature includes papers that examine current metaverse platforms as well as earlier virtual worlds.Before examining some of the factors influencing virtual shopping, it is worthwhile to look at typical features and aspects that are found in current v-commerce spaces. A study by Xi and Hamari  reviewed 72 academic sources on virtual shopping, to find out what kind of shopping experiences are being created using virtual reality. The study captured various aspects of the virtual worlds it reviewed including the type of simulated environment, the type of products being offered, which input/output devices were used, and other aspects. The review found that 37.35 % of virtual retail environments were used to create single retail stores, followed by supermarkets (16.87 %) and product shelves (16.87 %). Meanwhile, virtual shopping malls were only found in 4.82% of the reviewed literature. In terms of products, food and non-alcoholic beverages were displayed most commonly (30.12 %), followed by mixed products (20.48 %) and, clothing (14.48 %). Lastly, head-mounted displays were the by far the most used interface device, with a usage rate of 65.05 %, while regular PC monitors found the least usage with only 14.43 % . It is however questionable whether such a major preference for head-mounted displays over monitors would also be found among regular consumers, as they present a substantial investment. A British study on the acceptance of v-commerce has shown that only 25 % of participants would be willing to pay £200 for a head-mounted display, while 30 % would pay £15 – £80 and 20 % of participants were not willing to spend any money on them . Meanwhile, comparisons between numerous interface devices have shown, that head-mounted displays offer customers the best experience and generate a better consumer response in turn .With the metaverse establishing itself as a new and attractive sales channel, an increased amount of research has focused on the creation of experiences that are worthwhile to consumers. This research mainly takes place within the closely related fields of consumer behaviour and application design, which study the effects that certain design elements have on consumers as well as the responses that they trigger . Consumer behaviour research uses the consumer purchase model to divide a consumer’s purchasing decision into five logical steps, which start with the problem definition, followed by an information search, evaluation of alternatives, the purchasing decision, and the post-purchase evaluation . The most critical stage within this model is the purchasing decision. Within consumer behaviour research the metric most closely equated to a purchasing decision is purchasing intention, which is defined as “the\n",
      "strength of consumer’s willingness to buy a particular product, service, or products and\n",
      "services from a particular brand” . As such, numerous research papers have studied how virtual shopping spaces affect a consumer’s purchase intention and have tried to isolate the influencing factors . As mentioned earlier, one of the main advantages of a virtual shopping space is the sense of presence it gives to the consumers using the space . The effects of this phenomenon on consumer responses were evaluated in a 2019 study that compared consumer responses in virtual and physical stores. The study concluded that the sense of presence positively impacts consumer purchase intention as well as brand recall, which in turn also drives purchase intention. Additionally, presence was predominantly influenced by the emotions participants felt within the virtual space . Looking at further influencing factors, the two main determinants for presence in virtual worlds are its vividness and the degree of interactivity. Vividness relates to the visual representation of the space, including any kind of sensory cues, as well as how well these are presented . Similarly, Cummings and Bailenson describe the formation of presence as being achieved in a two-step process, in which users evaluate whether the visual representation of the space is realistic, as well as whether they can act with the environment .The look and feel as well as the layout of shopping spaces for traditional physical stores were extensively studied in the past. Such studies have examined the effects of sensory elements such as sight, hearing, and touch, which fall under the collective term of atmospherics. The findings of this research are being used by current metaverse studies, which try to evaluate, how store atmospherics translate from physical to virtual retail spaces . Atmospherics are extremely important to any form of retail. Research on online atmospherics shows that its influence on purchase decisions is stronger compared to in-store shopping  and is essential for creating engaging virtual communities . Atmospheric factors have traditionally been classified into non-visual ambient factors, e.g., music and lighting, visual design factors, which can serve either a functional or aesthetic purpose, and social factors, which include any type of human interactions within the store . With the move from in-store and (2D) online commerce to v-commerce, multiple authors have attempted to create an updated or entirely new typology of influencing factors. While some of the evaluated studies focus specifically on atmospherics, others examine the virtual shopping experience as a whole. Wu et al.  performed a study including 170 undergraduate participants and evaluated virtual retail stores created by the participants in a 3D modelling software. This method was used to identify and classify atmospheric design choices and elements. The study concluded that atmospheric elements could be classified into pathfinding assistance features, environment features or as product presentation features.Table 2 presents an overview of select features for each of the 3 atmospherics categories. Furthermore, in terms of effective design, the authors suggest the incorporation of multiple features per category but also note that an excess amount could lead to consumers experiencing information overload. Additionally, they highlight the effectiveness as well as the necessity for pathfinding features, which eased the navigation of the store and helped to maintain user engagement . Whereas this study offers three broad categories, other researchers propose a more detailed classification. By analysing 27 virtual stores in the metaverse platform Second Life, Hassouneh and Brengman  found, that virtual store characteristics can be categorised into 9 categories, which are the macro environment, store exterior, store layout, interior aesthetic design factors, store ambient factors, point-of-purchase, customer service, social factors, and entertainment factors. Using these categories to compare virtual and physical stores, the research found that in terms of atmospherics, virtual stores borrow much more from physical stores than from 2D websites. However, compared to physical stores, store interior elements are often used for entertainment, as opposed to functionality or aesthetics. Furthermore, product presentation is greatly impacted by the space available to the retailer. While small stores display products as two-dimensional images, which take up less space, bigger stores tend to display products as 3D models . Looking beyond atmospheric, additional research has focused on virtual store layouts and how these compare to the layouts utilised in physical stores. Commonly used retail store layouts include the grid, racetrack, and freeform layout. The layout a store implements has been shown to influence the shopping experience and as such layout choice is very much dependent on what the store sell. Grid layouts, which offer easy navigation, are often used for stores in which customers demand utilitarian value, such as grocery stores. Freeform layouts, on the other hand, are “perceived as the most pleasant, entertaining, and stimulating layout by consumers” . Consequently, freeform layouts have been identified as the ideal layout for virtual stores, as they complement the hedonic nature of virtual shopping experiences . While the above-mentioned studies focus on internal factors influencing the shopping experience, other studies have focused on or included external factors. As v-commerce presents a new technology to the majority of users, technology acceptance factors, such as changes in shopping behaviours, perceived convenience, and consumers’ attitudes towards new technologies, play an influencing role on the shopping experience . Research on the acceptance of v-commerce has shown that next to shopping value, age is one of the main determinants for technology acceptance. Younger (18-34) technology-aware consumers are more motivated to partake in virtual shopping than older consumers, who feel less inclined to give up their shopping habits. Additionally, v-commerce’s role as a new and novelty experience is one of the main motivations for consumers to try virtual shopping, which could result in a loss of motivation once the novelty effect wears off . As in physical retail, the number of external and internal factors influencing consumer behaviour is quite large. Through a systematic literature review, Shen et al have created a list of 15 external and internal factors, which ultimately influence the consumer purchase decision. While more extensive, the factors overlap with those named by . More interestingly, the identified model was used to propose a reference model of design artefacts and requirements for v-commerce applications.The researchers propose a model consisting of 5 distinct requirements, which include the type of immersive technology used, the design of the interface, efficient performance, intelligent automation, and functional aspects. Each requirement can be mapped to various design artefacts that influence purchase intention, examples of which can be seen in figure 5. The model offers a starting point for businesses building v-commerce applications, as well as a basis for researchers to evaluate them .To conclude this section, the following part will give a brief overview of some of the metaverse shopping experiences that are already available to consumers. The metaverse is becoming an increasingly attractive channel for organisations. The viability of virtualizing one’s business has in great part been influenced by the circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions that came with it . Apparel companies have been one of the first movers, in the attempt to virtualize. One of the major brands to enter the metaverse is the American sports brand Nike, who released NIKELAND on the virtual world platform Roblox in September of 2021, which has since been visited by over 31 million users . NIKELAND represents a virtual version of Nike’s real-life headquarter campus. Within the virtual space, users can explore the virtual headquarter, collect items, and join matches of various sports-themed games. Most importantly however, users are able to interact with virtual versions of Nike’s apparel, such as sneakers, which their avatars can wear, and which Nike can monetize in the form of NFTs . Three months after the release of NIKELAND, Nike acquired RTFKT studios, a company specializing in virtual apparel and items, further cementing their dedication to the metaverse . Prices for Nike’s virtual sneakers currently range between USD 248 – 8.647 on the NFT marketplace OpenSea .While Nike is a very prominent example, they are neither the only nor the first Brand to go virtual. In April 2021 urban apparel brand Vans released their virtual skateboard park Vans World. The space was built on the Roblox platform and has been visited over 92 million times to date . Similarly, to NIKELAND, Vans World tries to engage users through games, in the form of a skating park game. When users are not playing, they can purchase virtual vans apparel within the virtual stores . Within the apparel segment, luxury fashion brands, whose products are centred around prestige and hedonic value ,  have displayed a high degree of interest in v-commerce, specifically the sale of NFTs . Italian fashion brand Gucci has been among the front runners, within the luxury fashion segment. In 2021 the brand opened a virtual replica of their Gucci Garden for 2 weeks within Roblox, where users could buy virtual accessories, such as handbags. While these items were sold for USD 1.20 – 9 , one handbag later resold for the equivalent of USD 4,115, 715 more than its real-life counterpart .  Furthermore, the brand has announced another limited-time experience called Gucci Vault on the virtual world platform The Sandbox, where users will fulfil objectives and take part in raffles, with the chance to win virtual items . The metaverse is however not restricted to apparel brands. Representing consumer electronics, Korean company Samsung released its 837X Experience store on the Decentraland platform in January of 2022. The space, which is based on Samsung’s 837 experience store in New York City, consists of a virtual theatre, stage, and forest section. Users visiting the space can earn NFTs by completing objectives and are able to experience various art, fashion, and music influences . Furthermore, financial institutions, such as the German capital investment company Deka, who have opened a virtual information hub in Decentraland, or ING, who have built a virtual city within Roblox , are also represented in the metaverse . As the above examples showcase, the metaverse is drawing attention from various Companies and industries. As the clothing and accessory products translate very well from physical to virtual worlds, apparel brands such as Nike and Gucci have been keen to establish the metaverse as a new sales channel. However, companies outside the apparel industry are also creating experiences for their customers and are showing interest in the metaverse. Meanwhile, other companies are in a state of anticipation, waiting to see the outcomes of these initial steps into the metaverse.As the last main section of this literature review, the following section will examine how some of the underlying technology used to build virtual worlds such as the metaverse. This will include some of the basic concepts of 3D rendering as well as common design patterns used for the development of virtual spaces. The topics covered in this section will offer an overview of development practices but mainly provide the theoretical background necessary for later practical sections.At its most basic level, virtual worlds use a real-time 3D graphics system, which enables users to explore and navigate through virtual space. 3D graphics systems are used to create a continuous stream of images, also known as frames, which are updated multiple times per second and create the 3D graphics shown on the user’s interface . The process of creating 3D graphics involves the use of 3-dimensional data, which is transformed to be displayed on a 2-dimensional interface. This process is referred to as rendering and is utilised by real-time systems, which render the 3D graphics in quick succession, creating an image that seems continuous to the human eye . The steps involved in the rendering process are known as the 3D pipeline. Without going into too many intricacies, the rendering pipeline starts with vertices as its initial input data. A single vertex is a set of three coordinates which represent a point in a 3-dimensional space. By combining three vertices, triangles are formed and combined, leading to the 3D object being interpreted as a series of connected triangles. The resulting object is rendered to the screen through a method known as rasterization. Rasterization lays a 2D bitmap on top of the 3D objects with every tile of the raster mapping to a single pixel. The resulting output of this method is then rendered to the screen .In terms of computing, these transformation steps require the processor to perform various linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. As rendering is done continuously, the computational effort associated with it is high and is thus often outsourced to dedicated graphics processing units (GPU) . While 3D rendering pipelines are an essential part of displaying a 3-dimensional environment, the applications simulating the virtual world are referred to as Realtime Interactive Systems (RIS). RIS can be used for simulation purposes without the use of 3D rendering, however, most of them do offer an interface  and common use-cases include simulated virtual worlds for the purpose of virtual/augmented reality or video games . Simulations managed through RIS consist of entities, that populate the virtual space and tasks or events, which in combination with the entities create a virtual narrative . Similarly, Wiebusch and Latoschik describe the virtual environment as data in the form of the environment's state, which is altered through events, creating a sequence of changing states . The resulting simulation inside the RIS is known as a scene, which is managed through a scene graph, a tree-like data structure that places the scene entities within a hierarchy consisting of parent and child nodes . By traversing this scene graph the system knows, which parts of the scene require rendering . Examples of RIS include game engines such as Unity3D , which are mainly used in video game development as well as metaverse applications. As in other fields of software engineering, common design patterns and architectures have emerged over time. A typical architecture utilised by RIS is the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, which is commonly utilised in game engines such as Unity3D  as well as metaverse platforms such as Decentraland . As figure 6 shows, the ECS architecture fundamentally differentiates between the application's data, in the form of entities, and the systems which act on the data.  On the data side, components play a critical role as they contain the actual application data. Meanwhile, entities are initially empty objects, which can add or remove components as they are needed . Throughout the application's lifecycle, component data must react to certain events, which leads to a change in state. In the classical object-oriented programming paradigm, data and the systems acting upon it are typically encapsulated together within classes. However, concerning data and its behaviour ECS takes a different approach, as the system working with and updating the data is implemented completely separately from the entities that are influenced by the systems . It should also be noted that the algorithms defined within the systems run continuously once added to the engine. In order to mutate the applications state, a system subscribes to one or multiple components, which are then updated by the system on each iteration, leading to a change in the state of the entities containing these components . The ECS approach is a stark contrast to typical object-oriented design patterns, which becomes especially apparent through its preference for data composition over inheritance. The composition approach is favoured since it allows for more flexibility at runtime, as components can easily be added or removed . It should however be noted that systems using the ECS architecture are often implemented in an object-oriented language and as such make use of some object-oriented concepts , e.g., entities, systems and components are often defined in classes and are instantiated as objects.As shown in section 2.2.3, numerous brands are already using the metaverse to create virtual experiences for their customers. While companies could create these experiences from the ground up as part of their own virtual world, most use existing virtual spaces, with an existing user base, such as Roblox, Decentraland, etc. Being a platform, these services offer metaverse developers an environment in which they can develop and publish their virtual experience, which can be explored by the platform’s users . As of today, a multitude of these platforms exist, with popular examples being Roblox , Decentraland, Second Life, The Sandbox, Spatial and Fortnite . While heavily influenced by video games, the scope of metaverse platforms goes beyond that of a regular game in that they further combine social network aspects as seen in social media platforms and have a virtual economy that often makes use of blockchain technologies such as NFTs. Furthermore, the aspect of user creation plays a central part in metaverse platforms and allows users to create their own virtual assets, that range from individual virtual items to entire virtual spaces . Such assets are referred to as user-generated content (UGC) and encompass all virtual assets created by the platform’s users rather than the platform itself. Through the use of UGC, metaverse platforms can capitalise on the creativity of its users, who supply the platform with new content and in turn help foster the platform's community. The effectiveness and ability to innovate through UGC have been well documented in the gaming industry, where some of today’s most popular games such as Counter Strike and Defence of the Ancients 2 were originally developed as UGC for other games by the games users . While most video games do not provide any official means to create UGC, metaverse platforms, which try to promote UGC, incorporate various kinds of UGC editors. Such editors provide a toolkit for users to create UGC within the platform and without the need for third-party software. The editor’s functionality varies from platform to platform and can mainly be differentiated by the degree of autonomy it allows its users. This can be seen in UGC editors that allow the upload of external assets, versus those that only allow users to use those assets already offered by the platform . UGC editors can be found in most of the major metaverse platforms. Roblox offers its Roblox Studio editor, which includes a visual editor and scripting functionality . Similarly, Decentraland offers a basic visual builder tool as well as a software development kit (SDK) for more advanced content . Other tools such as The Sandbox’s Game Maker do not require any programming skills . As UGC is a major part of the metaverse experience, the editors that provide the user with the tools to create this content represent an integral part of metaverse platforms. The combination of a virtual world and the tools to construct it has been called an Integrated Virtual World Platform (IVWP) by Matthew Ball in his book “The Metaverse And How It Will Revolutionize Everything” .  While not an academic source, Ball points out how IVWP such as Roblox have immensely simplified building virtual spaces by offering an accessible abstraction layer on top of the underlying game engines, that require limited to no programming skills, making these platforms increasingly accessible for new users, and increasing the amount of UGC . With the literature review concluded, the following section marks the beginning of the practical section of this thesis. As such, this section will describe the development and implementation of a white-label shopping solution for the metaverse. To provide a holistic overview, the solution will be explained from various viewpoints starting with an overview of the white-label solution that will provide some context about the project and explain the business model. Following the introduction, the focus will switch to the actual implementation of the solution, starting with the development process and the technologies utilised to build the solution. Subsequently, the development process as defined will be followed, starting with the definition of the solution's requirements, and ending with an overview of the design artefacts used to meet them.The development and launch of the white-label metaverse solution was conducted parallel to this thesis, which was written as part of a three-month work placement at the company Worldline. Worldline SA is a French CAC 40 listed company, which specialises in the field of payments technology. Through its payment platforms and products, the company accepts and processes payments on the acquiring as well as issuing side of the payments system for customers that require payment acceptance, referred to as merchants, as well as financial institutions that require payment processing . The work placement was spent within the Crypto & Metaverse Competence Centre, a newly founded department, that handles the implementation, business development, marketing, and communications for Worldline’s crypto and metaverse related products. The department has had previous metaverse experience with its Worldline Showroom, a virtual space within the Decentraland platform, used to display and promote the Worldline brand and certain solutions. Within the payments industry, processors and acceptance providers such as Worldline traditionally operate within the realm of physical in-store payments and e-commerce. While these channels are already being utilised and are characterised by a competitive landscape, the metaverse and more specifically v-commerce, represents a new and unexplored channel. With consumers spending more time in virtual spaces, spending in these spaces has increased as well. A 2022 report by McKinsey estimates the daily metaverse trading volume of NFT to be around USD 250 million. Additionally, the metaverse platform Roblox has generated transactions exceeding USD 14 billion in 2018-2020 . Worldline and companies like it, recognize a significant opportunity to establish v-commerce as a third major payments channel, in which they can offer payment acceptance solutions. Hence, the white-label metaverse solution can be seen as Worldline's initial steps in establishing itself as a major player in the emerging metaverse space and the v-commerce channel. With regards to the project’s scope, the development of the solution spanned a two-month period, that started in January 2023, and which was followed by the launch of the solution in March 2023. Throughout this period a project team of four people were involved in the project, including the project owner, a marketing and communications manager, and two developers who were responsible for implementing the solution.Within the software development space, a “white-label” product or solution is defined as a product that can be rebranded in the look and feel of a customer, who can sell it as their own product. While creating customised versions for each customer, the solution utilises the same codebase for each rebranded version . Hence, the Worldline white label metaverse offering aims to provide customers with the opportunity to easily set up a metaverse presence and utilise this channel for their sales and advertising purposes. To this end, the white-label solution has taken on the shape of a virtual mall, comprising individual stores, which serve as the solution’s white-label component. Potential customers can lease store spaces and subsequently rebrand them in accordance with their corporate identity. Furthermore, customers can define various store interior elements, including the products they would like to display, where these should be placed and how they should behave. Upon entering the mall, users can view the products displayed in the stores, receive information on them, and are able to purchase them. Collectively, this solution offers companies a quick and uncomplicated means to establish a metaverse presence and set up a store, which will be customised to their needs. For the launch of the initial solution, which is covered in this thesis, the virtual mall offers a maximum of 15 stores. In addition, the mall building features a virtual event space, which can be utilised to host as well as live stream events. Regarding the platform, users can access the virtual mall on the Decentraland metaverse platform, which it was specifically developed for. Decentraland was the platform of choice over other popular platforms mainly due to its low entry barriers for its users. In comparison to other popular platforms such as Roblox or The Sandbox, Decentraland is one of the only platforms that offers a web application that users can access through their browsers. The platform also offers a downloadable client for users that prefer to use the platform outside the browser. Additionally, users can enter the virtual world as guests without an account. While the social functionalities are limited for guest users, this takes away an entry barrier, especially for new users. Furthermore, Decentraland is unique in that it is operated almost completely decentralised. Like many other platforms, Decentraland has its own cryptocurrency called MANA, which is an Ethereum-based token that can be used to make purchases within the platform. However, decentralisation is not limited to the currency. The virtual land in Decentraland is represented as a grid of parcels, with each parcel represented as an x and y coordinate on the grid amounting to a 16x16 metre plot of land in in-game units. Parcels can be purchased by users using the MANA currency. Ownership of the land, as well as other assets, is handled through the Ethereum blockchain, where the ownership of each parcel is tracked as a unique token or NFT. With their purchased parcels, landowners can utilise the land as they please, either building their own virtual space or renting the space to other users. Land rentals are supported by Decentraland, which offers users access to a virtual marketplace, where landowners are able to create listings. Like in real-world real estate markets, prices and rental periods are decided upon by the owners and are thus influenced by supply and demand. This leads to parcels in highly frequented regions demanding higher rents and prices than those in less frequented regions, typically those furthest from the centre of the virtual world.As the virtual mall housing the stores is supposed to contain 15 stores, multiple parcels were required for the solution. To accommodate all stores, eight parcels were needed, which were rented on the Decentraland marketplace as a plot of 4x2 parcels, which amounts to a 64x32 metre plot of virtual land. The decision to rent versus buy was mainly made due to cost reasons, as Decentraland Land prices can range between 2.490 - 7.000.000 MANA  with a MANA to Euro conversion rate of 0.521 at the time of writing. While the 4x2 plot is only able to accommodate five stores, landowners can build vertically to maximise the use of their space. Thus, the mall was conceived as a four-floor building, with the first three floors containing the white-label stores, and the top floor being utilised as the event space.As the business model is a critical aspect of launching a new solution, the following section will focus on various components of the white label metaverse solution, which in sum lead to a solution that creates value for its customers. The most relevant aspects of the solutions will be documented using select business model building blocks as defined by Osterwalder .With the metaverse establishing itself as a new and attractive channel, numerous organisations are trying to gauge the potential of this channel. Worldline’s white-label metaverse solution enables its customers to easily build up a metaverse presence where they can offer shopping experiences and gauge their customer's reactions to better understand the channel's potential. Within worldlines virtual mall, customers are quickly able to set up a store, which will be customised to fit the company's look and feel. Additionally, customers can utilise worldline’s payment capabilities to accept payments within their store. Furthermore, Worldline can help customers set up targeted metaverse advertisements as well as phygital, AR and VR versions of their products. The white-label solution will be distributed in a business-to-business context. It will target organisations which display interest in the metaverse channel but lack the know-how or do not want to make the initial investment required to develop and maintain a virtual experience of their own. Looking at specific industries, retail merchants looking to establish the v-commerce channel are a primary target segment, as Worldline can utilise its existing customer relationships from its acceptance business and offer these customers the chance to display their products and accept payments within their virtual space.As the solution is targeting B2B customers, distribution of it will primarily take place through direct sales in the form of account management, which will place offers with existing accounts and work to build relationships with new customers. Online channels such as LinkedIn as well as the Worldline homepage will be used as promotion channels to garner attention and excitement. Given that the stores are being maintained and run in the customer’s name, it is essential to provide each customer with personalized support. As each customer will be managed personally, the account manager will be their primary contact, with which they can discuss changes and improvements to their store. Establishing such direct and clear communication channels will help strengthen the customer relationship and help create cross-selling opportunities within the white-label solution or for other Worldline products.The solution will create value for customers through various key activities involving the development and delivery of the solution. The development of the solution, including the initial design, as well as the implementation, will be the main value-creating activity. With the base solution developed, implementing individual stores, and adjusting them to meet the customers' expectations will be key. Furthermore, after the first iteration of the solution is completed, development on the solution will continue with the aim of implementing further improvements and features. From a business perspective, it will be essential to formulate and implement a sales strategy, along with a marketing plan that includes the development of marketing content for multiple channels.The solution uses a subscription-based revenue model, in which customers pay a recurring fee to gain access to a shop inside the virtual mall. The standard subscription plan includes a single store that Worldline will implement according to the client's preferences, including the products and adverts they want to incorporate. However, customers have the choice to buy additional add-ons. The benefits of these add-on packages include the creation of phygital products that can be utilised in both virtual and physical environments, the creation of 3D model replicas of their products, and 3D advertisement models for displaying targeted ads. Additionally, as Worldline provides the means of accepting fiat currencies within the Decentraland platform, customers will be charged a transaction fee for each successful purchase.The following section will cover various aspects of the solution development. This will include the development process, requirements and design artefacts that culminated in the final launch product. To follow the process in sequential order, the section will begin by explaining how the development process was structured and discuss the tools and technologies that were utilised as part of it. Subsequently, the requirements of the solution will be defined followed by a review of the design artefacts used to meet each requirement.This section will encompass all steps of the development from the initial requirements analysis to the launch of the solution. The process of implementing the solution was split into three main phases starting with the initial requirements analysis, followed by the implementation of the base solution and, lastly, the implementation of the individual stores as well as the continuous integration and deployment of the solution. Figure 8 shows the individual phase in sequence. Starting from the beginning, the identification of functional and non-functional requirements was an essential first step in creating a blueprint for the implementation of the solution. Requirements were identified through multiple brainstorming sessions, which included the developers, the project manager and other relevant stakeholders. The resulting requirements were documented and ranked in terms of priority and mapped to one or multiple design artefacts.While most requirements were defined during the initial analysis, further requirements were added during the preceding implementation phase. With the requirements mapped to individual design artefacts, the implementation of the base solution was started. In terms of the duration of the project, this phase was the most time-consuming. The design artefacts, which mapped to the requirements were used as work packages to be implemented. Within weekly sprints, artefacts were picked with respect to their priority, implemented and presented to the project owner. With the base implementation completed, the solution met all of the defined functional requirements and was thus in a launch-ready state that could be offered to potential customers.  The final project phase was split into a pre- and post-launch stage. In terms of activities, this phase consisted of the implementation of customer shops, which was done on an ad hoc basis as customers leased the store space, as well as further development and integration of the non-functional requirements. Looking at the store implementation, the aim was to find nine initial customers, which, in addition to Worldline's own store, would fill the first 10 store slots of the mall for the launch of the solution. With nine initial slots sold, the mall was launched onto the live Decentraland servers. The launch of the solution marked the end of the project as such and the transition to post-launch operations, which saw further integration and modifications to the virtual stores, as well as continuous integration and deployment of features. The technology stack refers to the combination of frameworks, programming languages and software tools used to build a piece of software. The following segment will discuss the technologies and tools that were most critical in the implementation of the white-label solution.In terms of programming languages, the solution was entirely written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript programming language, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is a popular option for JavaScript developers, as it adds a type system and static type checker to JavaScript, making it a statically typed language as opposed to a dynamically typed language. Being a superset, all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, making the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript very easy. The difference between these two languages lies in the fact that TypeScript types are checked at compile time, as opposed to runtime. Additionally, TypeScript can be strongly typed, as it is possible to assign variable types . While the addition of types requires some additional typing effort, errors within the code are detected without the need to execute it, leading to the code containing fewer undetected bugs. Furthermore, the addition of types increases the readability of the code, thereby easing future modifications. TypeScript was chosen, as it is required by the Decentraland SDK, however, the static type checking helped prevent many type and spelling errors, speeding up the development time and making for a less frustrating development experience. While the platform itself is built on top of the Unity game engine, Decentraland requires developers to utilise its software development kit (SDK) to develop for the platform. The SDK is a front-end framework that allows Decentraland content creators to build virtual scenes, which can be deployed to the Decentraland platform. It requires the use of TypeScript and utilises an entity-component-system architecture with the addition of some basic object-oriented elements. In addition to the development framework, the SDK includes a powerful command line interface (CLI), which offers developers useful functionalities, such as the ability to generate the initial project structure, preview the scene locally with integrated hot reloading, and the option to deploy the scene to test and production environments . Development for this project using the Decentraland SDK was done within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. VS Code is the recommended code editor for Decentraland development and offers the official Decentraland Editor extension, which can be installed from the VS Code extensions tab. The editor extension was very useful, as it offers a graphical interface for scene deployment and local previews and allows 3D model files to be directly previewed from within VS Code. Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics (CG) software. It provides an extensive 3D creation suite featuring 3D creation functionality such as 3D modelling, animations, rendering etc, which are utilised for the creation of 3D models . While Decentraland does not dictate which CG software creators should utilise to create 3D models, all 3D model-related documentation uses Blender, and it is recommended as the platform's preferred CG tool. Within the development process, Blender was used for 3D modelling, 3D animations as well as the editing of existing models. Due to its extensive feature set, Blender has an extremely high learning curve, however, once a basic level has been reached it is extremely effective in what it does.  The tool was especially effective in decreasing triangle counts of 3D models, with its built-in Decimate modifier, which was often necessary to remain below the scene resource limitations.Inkscape is a vector graphics editor that is utilised to create and edit vector images as well as other image formats. Like Blender, Inkscape is an open-source software and completely free of charge. The tool was mainly used while implementing customer stores. While customers received a template stating the exact specification, many of them supplied their marketing material in the wrong formats and dimensions. Inkscape was used to reformat such images to meet the exact requirements, while not compromising image quality. Moreover, the tool was used in conjunction with Blender, which can utilise vector graphics as the base for 3D models. Inkscape offers a multitude of options for tracing vector images from bitmaps. Using these capabilities, customers' marketing material could be imported to Blender, where it was used to create 3D models.Lastly, while not a technology, tool or framework, the Decentraland Awesome Repository was an incredibly useful resource, that was used throughout the entire development process and should be mentioned as such. The Awesome Repository is a publicly available GitHub repository that was created by the Decentraland DAO and has been maintained and extended by community contributors . The repository links to over 50 Decentraland scenes, which act as examples of how common features can be implemented. As the Decentraland documentation is rather limited, these example scenes were an extremely helpful resource during the implementation. In addition, all assets used in the repository, such as 3D models and textures, are publicly available. Many of these were used or modified for the white-label solution.The following requirements were defined prior to the development of the solution and were defined to help with the creation of the design artefacts. Each requirement was mapped to at least one artefact, which was implemented in form of a work package. While requirements will be explained in this section, the implementation of design artefacts will be covered in section 3.2.3. Requirements were grouped using the five design requirement categories for virtual commerce platforms proposed by Shen et al. .As its most fundamental feature, the solution must provide users with a 3D virtual space, which they are able to fully explore. In order to provide a sense of immersion and an engaging experience, users must be able to move freely within this space without being limited to any fixed paths. Additionally, entering the virtual space must be intuitive and should be done without encountering major entry barriers. This should result in a user-friendly experience, which encourages potential new users to try out the solution.As a sense of presence is one of the main determinants for users purchasing intention, the solutions user interface, in the form of the virtual mall and its shops, should be designed interactively and responsively. In greater detail, this means that the mall and store layout should be designed to feel intuitive and be easy to navigate by the user, minimising the time spent searching for a product. In terms of the store’s offerings, the products on display must look and feel authentic. Additionally, these should allow the user some degree of interactivity and provide responsive feedback, adding to the 3D authenticity.The proposed solution intends to support up to 15 virtual stores at the outset. However, the interface of the solution must be designed with the flexibility to expand and accommodate an even larger selection of tenants in the future. The interface, in this case, refers to the visual appearance of the mall and the virtual stores it showcases. The scalability of the solution will become particularly crucial when considering its deployment across various geographical regions. Although the primary focus of the initial launch will be on European customers, it is vital that the solution is adaptable and can cater to the demands of other regions, such as North America, Asia, or Oceania. Therefore, the interface must provide the flexibility to display relevant virtual stores to the users based on their respective regions. Additionally, stores should be implemented in a clean and maintainable manner, which supports fast adjustments and quick customer onboarding.As every Decentraland parcel represents a 3D rendered scene, which requires computational resources, the platform has defined a set of scene limitations which every scene is required to follow. The platform has set these limits for performance reasons, to ensure that the world's overall performance is not limited by certain scenes that require extensive rendering. The scene limitation concern multiple 3D resources, which are utilised to build the virtual space, as well as size constraints for files, which are uploaded to Decentraland’s content servers . Table 4 provides an overview of the scene limitations set by the platform.While some of these resource limits grow with the number of parcels a scene contains, certain resources such as materials, textures and scene height grow logarithmically, leading to multi-parcel land plots, such as the 4x2 plot used for the white label solution, seeing demising returns for each additional parcel. Furthermore, as parcels are only counted on the two horizontal axes, scenes with multi-floor buildings, such as the mall, receive even fewer resources per building floor. Since scenes that exceed these limits will not be rendered, managing the available resources efficiently is a basic functional requirement. The scene's performance is closely related to the resources listed above, that will be utilised in the development process. The number of resources a scene utilises and how these are implemented greatly influences the performance of the scene, in terms of the frames per second the user experiences. Having a smooth frame rate is of utmost importance for the solution, as it influences usability as well as the immersive experience. Users experiencing low frame rates will find it difficult to navigate and interact with the environment, which makes for a frustrating experience. Achieving an expectable frame rate is thus a functional requirement, while high framer ates, that increase the level of immersion, will be seen as a qualitative requirement. It should however be noted that measuring the success of this requirement will present a challenge, as frame rates are very much dependent on the hardware, specifically the presence of a GPU, that is used to access the virtual space.Stores should be designed in a modular manner. While each store must be based on the same template canvas, all customizable elements should be added to the base product as components, which can be easily added or removed and customised to the tenants’ wishes. Component modules must be created for the store's branding, products, advertisement, social media and video and audio options. Additionally, the stores themselves should be implemented as self-contained modules that can easily be moved around without any effect on the store’s interior. The use of modules should also make for a more scalable solution as modifications and additions can be added without the need to rework other sections of the codebase.While Decentraland allows users to purchase and sell virtual goods and land on their platform, these transactions can only be made using the platform's own cryptocurrency MANA. This will display a problem for most store owners wanting to sell directly through the platform as accepting a cryptocurrency will add a further layer of complexity and risk to the transaction. Therefore, the solution must offer store owners the option of accepting regular fiat currency from within their virtual store. The integration of the payment acceptance method should be as seamless and convenient as possible and conducting a transaction should not require the user to leave the platform.To provide an overview of the solution's usage and user preferences, the solution must integrate a method of collecting user data. This data will help provide a thorough understanding of the solutions' usage and user preferences, such as the number of users visiting the mall and how much time they spend in it as well as the origin of the user. Furthermore, the collected data should offer insights into user behaviour, such as the preferred areas and stores of the mall. These insights will help monitor the solution's performance in terms of usage and provide a better understanding of user preferences, which will help inform future design decisions. With the requirements defined, the subsequent section will focus on the implementation of these. As previously stated, each requirement was mapped to one or more design artefacts, which were implemented during the implementation phase. The following table provides an overview of all solution requirements, which have been clustered using the requirements categories proposed by Shen et al. . The right column of the table shows each requirement’s design artefact. These artefacts will be covered in this section, with the focus lying on their implementation and how they met their matching requirement.The virtual shopping mall is the canvas for the entire solution and as such was the first artefact to be implemented. The mall utilised the 4x2 land plot, which was rented on the Decentraland marketplace and provided a 64x32x63 metre area. Before creating the virtual building, it was necessary to create a basic structure that could be used as a blueprint for the design and implementation that followed.The scene structure was documented in the form of a scene graph. As figure 9 shows the mall building constitutes the root element of the scene and contains four direct sub-scenes in the form of the building’s floors. Each floor scene, except for the event space, contains a total of five stores, which was the maximum number the land plot could accommodate. Again, each store represents its own sub-scene, containing the module contents specified by the customer. With the conceptual layout completed, implementing the mall building required the 3D modelling of the building. Concerning the modelling, it was decided to create individual building components, such as the walls, floors, glass, and the roof, as opposed to a single building model. While this required the components to be individually arranged, subsequent changes to the building would be easier to make. This was made use of to implement multiple operating modes through which the building could quickly be switched from three to four floors, depending on customer demand. In terms of the buildings' look and feel, glass materials were used on the street phasing sides, allowing users to view the stores from the outside. Additionally, worldline branding was incorporated into the facade of the building. Figure 10 shows the shopping mall in Decentraland. A detailed explanation of the design features will be given in the following section and additional pictures of the mall exterior and interior are available in the appendix.Virtual store atmospherics plays a crucial role in creating a virtual space that offers its users a sense of immersion and presence. In order to build an experience, which creates these sensations, multiple pathfinding, environmental and product presentation features were implemented to promote the scenes' atmospheric design. These features will be explained in the following section.Environmental atmospheric features include the space’s overall theme, the use of lighting as well sensory elements such as audio or video. Each of these features was incorporated into the mall and individual store design. Starting with the overall theme of the virtual mall, the aim was to create a modern and visually pleasing look, with some futuristic elements befitting the metaverse. Thus, in terms of the building’s facade, glass materials were used whenever possible, with the addition of wooden materials on the building’s backside and floors. In addition, neon light strips were utilised to outline the building's edges, giving it a distinct look. The futuristic theme was further expanded upon in the building’s interior, through the use of hovering advertisement billboards and teleporters allowing the user to instantly move from floor to floor, as opposed to stairs. Furthermore, lighting was used to distinguish between different spaces within the building. While each floor utilises Decentralands global light source, the store’s interior received additional light sources, making for a much brighter environment. The additional lighting helps users view the 3D models within the stores, as these look more vibrant with additional lighting. As stores were individually configured, content varied from store to store. Store owners can include products, branding, advertising, social media, as well as audio and video options in their store, which could be added in the form of modules, with each module defining a maximum number of configurable elements. The product presentation features include all “Methods of showing individual products and product information” . These features mainly pertained to the product module, which was implemented to utilise all display options the Decentraland SDK offers. Hence, tenants can choose to display products in the form of 3D models, 2D images as well as NFTs. These product types can vary from product to product, allowing stores to display a combination of them. Product information is displayed by hovering over the product, in form of a short description, and by clicking the product, which leads to a specified description page. In addition, custom components and systems were implemented to bring products to life and increase 3D authenticity. This included the addition of animation systems to add rotation as well as vertical and horizontal movements to products. Likewise, scale transitions were used in combination with event listeners, to create hover effects similar to those used in many websites to provide additional interactivity and responsiveness to the user’s actions. The pathfinding features included navigational elements as well as the layout of both the mall building and the individual stores. To allow for easy traversal of the scene, navigational elements were added to each floor. This includes an overview of the mall at the mall's entrance, showing users which stores are located on each floor. Additionally, signs pointing players to the teleporters were utilised as using these to switch floor levels is not as obvious as the use of stairs. In terms of layout, stores were placed in a row of five per floor. The linear layout was used due to the space constraints of the scene, which would only allow for the stores to be placed in this fashion. Meanwhile, stores allowed for more layout options. While customers are able to choose the exact layout of their store, a standard store layout was proposed. The standard layout utilises a racetrack approach, which allows for a total of seven products, four on the outside and three in the middle, two advertisement walls, a social media section, and a video screen. While customers can request other layout options such as a grid or freeform layout, this layout was chosen as it promotes an intuitive store traversal. Additionally, dividing products between the centre and outside of the store limits the amount of visual clutter. To address the scalability requirement, the geo-location functionality was added to allow the solution to scale into other geographic regions in the future. To incorporate this feature, the solution must determine the user’s geographical origin, which is based on their IP address, and render the mall stores that are mapped to that region or country. Geo-location functionality can easily be integrated through paid and free API services, however, most free services did not offer encrypted endpoints which are required for all requests made from within the Decentraland scene. As such the geoPlugin API was chosen, which offers access to an encrypted API endpoint for a small yearly subscription. The API main advantage of this API service was that it can directly scrape the IP address off the sender’s request, whereas other services required the IP to be passed as a request parameter, requiring the use of a further API to find out the user's IP address. The code snippet in figure 10 showcases how the API was utilised within the solution. If the region parameter is left unspecified, the API is called to determine the user’s location, delivering a response object which specifies the city, state, country, and continent of the request. Using this information, the database is queried for the respective regions' store data. The data is returned by the function and further utilised to render the stores for the user.At the time of writing, geo-location specific stores are not yet being utilised as there is simply no demand for them at present. However, should specific regions display interest in the future, this is an effective measure to easily scale the solution to additional customers. Additionally, users could be given the option of switching to different regions, after initially being shown the stores in their region, further increasing the amount of content.The main building includes up to four floors, with each floor (excluding the event space) displaying multiple 3D models and images. As such, the scene is rather dense in terms of content, which presents a problem due to the scene resource limits set by Decentraland. After building and store contents were initially implemented, the scene exceeded the triangle, material, and texture resource limits by more than double, meaning it could not have been deployed. The problem with the initial approach was that all scene content was loaded and rendered as soon as the scene was initialised. Rendering all content at all times is not necessary since the users only view a fraction of the scene at any given time. To alleviate this problem a lazy loading system was implemented. Lazy loading is a common design pattern used to improve application performance, by not loading content upfront but as it is needed. The lazy loading functionality had to be implemented, as the Decentraland SDK does not offer any built-in functionality for it. However, the Decentraland Awesome Repository proposes a scene management module, through which lazy loading can be utilised.  The UML class diagram for the module is shown in figure 12. And a complete version of the diagram including class methods is available in the appendix. The scene management module provides a framework which allows the scene to be divided into multiple sub-scenes, which can be individually managed in terms of rendering. This is done through the SubScene-class, which represents sub-scenes as invisible box entities, referred to as trigger entities or trigger areas. The BaseEntityWrapper acts as the SubScenes superclass and provides the sub-scenes trigger entities with an on-show event listener, which is triggered by users entering the trigger area, and the on-hide listeners, that is activated on the user leaving the trigger area. Using these events, allows sub-scenes to be rendered only when the user sees them, i.e., when the user enters the trigger area. Similarly, the scene is rendered invisible on the user leaving the trigger area. Furthermore, sub-scenes can use two lazy load strategies, which are specified through a flag within the BaseEntityWrapper class. Depending on the chosen strategy the sub-scene entity is either completely removed from the engine while not visible or is kept in the engine but not rendered. These strategies provide different benefits and make use of the fact that most scene resource limits only apply to entities that are rendered. Removing and adding scenes from the engine will provide the greatest performance benefit and save the most resources, however adding the scene back into the engine can be resource intensive.Alternatively, the sub-scene can remain in the engine but remain invisible while not being viewed. This strategy also provides performance benefits, but not to the extent of the first strategy, as the engine still has to manage the scene while it is not being rendered. However, keeping the sub-scene in the engine decreases its loading time. In addition to the rendering strategies, sub-scenes have an on-init listener, listening to the initialisation of the entire scene, making it possible to immediately add sub-scenes to the engine on initialisation or waiting for the user to trigger the scene. Using this setup gives full control over the sub-scene lifecycle, from the scene’s initialisation on to all subsequent visits by the user. The possibilities further increase when considering how these strategies extend to the entities that live within the sub-scene. The SubScene-class can manage entities, which upon being added to the sub-scene are wrapped into an EntityWrapper-object. As figure 11 shows, the EntityWrapper-class, like the SubScene-class, extends the BaseEntityWrapper, giving entities within sub-scenes access to the rendering strategies described above. This is very powerful as it allows for some interesting combinations of loading and rendering strategies on the sub-scene and entity levels. Utilising this framework, each building floor was implemented as its own sub-scene, leaving the building’s facade as the only statically loaded model. The store buildings located on the floors would as such only be loaded and rendered when users entered the floor. The store’s interior was implemented as its own sub-scene managing all store content. Utilising sub-scenes within sub-scenes saved additional scene resources, as models within the stores only require rendering when the user is in viewing distance. Additionally, 3D models were given different rendering strategies depending on their resource intensity, with intricate models being removed from the engine while not visible, while smaller models utilise the invisibility strategy. In sum the scene management and the lazy loading it allows reduced the scenes resource usage by almost 70 %, which was crucial in complying with the resource limitation. The implementation was a very laborious process, as the scene was initially implemented without any kind of lazy loading in mind and the integration required fundamental reworks. Developers building resource-intensive scenes should as such consider integrating this approach from the ground up.   At a fundamental level, adding and positioning entities in virtual space is a straightforward task. However, doing so without any kind of structure can quickly lead to a cluttered code base that is difficult to maintain and adjust. With the scene containing up to 15 stores, each containing over ten entities, it was essential to use a structured approach to manage the scene's content. To this end, a modular approach was employed, building on the sub-scene implementation discussed earlier. Content modules were defined for every configurable aspect of the store, resulting in five modules at the time of launch. These modules include the product, branding, advertising, social media, and media module. Each module consisted of two components: the module's content (e.g., product models, names, animations, and descriptions), specified in a database document for each store, and the script that implements the content, shared by all stores using the module. Since the same script is used for all stores, separating these components minimises code duplications as well as the implementation, and modification effort. With the individual content modules implemented, this approach was further expanded to the store level. Instead of directly adding each module to its respective store, modules are packaged into a single content package, which is set as a child entity of the store entity. The store to which a content package corresponds is specified in the database. This information is then used by the implementation script to add the package to the correct store. Separating the base store from the content package was an advantageous approach during the implementation of customer stores, particularly in light of the frequent alterations to the store arrangement. Typically, such rearrangements require the repositioning of all entities present in the store. However, as content modules are bundled as child entities of the store, simply adjusting the mapping between content packages and stores within the database causes the implementation script to update the parent entity of the package, leading to an automatic repositioning of the store. This approach makes use of the fact that the position components of parent entities are not overridden by child entities but compounded, meaning that as long as the module content is initially positioned correctly, it will always be positioned the same no matter which store is set as its parent. To enable shop owners to accept fiat currency within their virtual stores, the solution provides customers with payment links. These links can be accessed by clicking on a virtual product and selecting the \"buy\" option, which opens the payment link in a separate tab, where the user can enter their data and confirm the purchase. The payment links are created using Worldlines online payment solution Saferpay, which is commonly utilised for accepting payments in e-commerce use cases and business applications. The solution also enables merchants without online shops to include payment links in their invoices, which their customers use to pay . These payment links have been adopted for use in the metaverse context. For shop owners that want to sell directly from their virtual store, payment links can be generated with the Saferpay solution, allowing customers to buy products without exiting the platform. As with regular Saferpay transactions, Worldline will receive a transaction fee for every successful transaction.While the aforementioned payment links make it easy for stores to accept fiat currencies, Decentralands officially uses the MANA cryptocurrency. However, while MANA is its domestic currency, there is currently no way to purchase it from within the platform. Like other cryptocurrencies, MANA can be bought on various popular crypto exchange platforms, which requires users to access another platform. As this is not an ideal scenario multiple crypto ATMs were integrated into the mall building. Through these ATMs, users can add the necessary funds to their crypto wallets from within Decentraland. The ATMs offer a user interface where users can choose whether they would like to buy or sell currency. This leads the users to a form, which opens in a separate tab, where they are able to choose how much MANA they would like to buy and with which payment method . For users, this is an easy way of buying the necessary MANA funds, which they can spend within the mall or in any other scene. Within the SDK the ATMs are represented as custom entities, that extend the base entity class, and encapsulate business logic and further entities. The ATMs were developed by the company Transak, who shared the source code with the Worldline team for implementation, in order to promote the ATMs through the launch of the solution. In terms of user analytics, the Decentraland platform offers landowners and operators basic metrics. While these metrics do offer some form of insights, they are limited in scope as they only capture weekly users, sessions, and the peak number of concurrent users. More importantly, the data is refreshed weekly, without the ability to view the previous week's statistics. To gain additional insights, the atlas analytics platform was integrated into the solution. The platform is a third-party solution, which was created from a grant given by the Decentraland DAO and is one of the officially recommended analytics solutions. Scenes, which integrate atlas analytics receive access to the platform’s online dashboard, where various metrics are tracked over time. Metrics include the number of scene users, their geographic origin, the percentage of guests versus registered users, a scene traffic heat map, as well as device, and browser statistics. In addition, developers can track specific events within the scene. This was utilised to track users’ movement between the building's floors as well as how often displayed products were clicked. At present, this platform is free to all Decentraland landowners. In terms of integration, the platform presently does not offer an API or npm package. The necessary source code file can be downloaded from the platform's public GitLab repository and has to be placed in the project's source directory. This gives developers access to the platform’s custom component, which will track the scene as well as the specified events, as mentioned above. While the manual integration, without a npm package, is not optimal, the setup was simple, only requiring basic modifications to the custom component.After almost two and a half months of development time, the white-label metaverse solution was launched on the eighth of March 2023 in Decentraland. The solution was launched as a three-floor building, with a total of nine stores. The following section will be used to showcase the results, including an overview of the customers the solution was able to attract and how these used the content modules to configure their store. Additionally, various user statistics will be showcased. These results will be followed by a discussion and analysis of the results.Starting with the store owners. As mentioned above, a total of nine stores were implemented at the time of launch, which included eight customer stores as well as one store operated by Worldline itself. This was enough to nearly fill the first two floors of the mall. As such the building was launched with three total stories as opposed to four, with a total of six further stores available for rental. Table 6 provides an overview of the customers renting a store within the mall. While customers showed a lot of variety regarding the industry they operate in, in terms of company size a majority of the companies fall into the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) category, with a median size of 50 employees, excluding Worldline. Looking at the company’s origin, all companies, except for the Australian merchant Naked Life, have European origins with five of the eight customers originating from either Switzerland or Germany.Going on to the stores, customers were given numerous options to configure their stores in the form of customizable modules. Table 7 showcases which modules were utilised for each store, and to which extent. The product and media modules were divided into their main options of 3D models, images, and NFTs and videos and audio respectively, to provide a better understanding of which module options were used the most.Starting with the product modules, 3D models were utilised in all stores and were the preferred display option for six out of nine stores. Meanwhile, images and NFTs saw less usage, with four stores not utilising any images for their products. NFTs were only utilised by the company SNGLR, which used six of its seven product slots as NFTs. Going on to the media module, customers had the option of adding triggered videos and audio elements to their store. This module was utilised by all but three customers, who used neither video nor audio elements. Out of the remaining six that did use the media module, four stores used the video and music options in combination, while two included only videos. With regards to the advertisement module, stores could make use of two advertisement spaces, that can each rotate four advertisement banners.  The module was made use of by all stores except SNGLR, which chose to utilise this store space for NFTs. However, while eight out of nine stores deployed some kind of advertising, only two of these eight utilised more than 50 % of their available advertising space, with only one store utilising all eight. Lastly, the social media module was utilised by all customers, who used the social elements to direct users to their social media pages. Going beyond the data in table 7, in terms of payment methods, none of the stores utilised payment links to allow users to buy their products from within the virtual store. Instead, they chose to redirect users to the listing of the product on their company’s website. Furthermore, when it came to store layout, all customers used the standard layout proposed by Worldline.Data on the scene’s usage was collected using atlas analytics and was collected starting with the solution's launch. Table 8 provides an overview of the most relevant metrics that were collected. The data includes the first three weeks following the launch of the solution. Within the first three weeks, the scene was visited by a total of 145 users, leading to a weekly average of 48 users. Most notably, user numbers peaked during the launch week and declined in the following weeks. This also applies to the maximum concurrent users, which similarly declined after the initial launch week. Within the three weeks, users from up to fifteen countries visited the scene. Users visiting the space spend an average of nineteen minutes within the mall. Furthermore, in terms of platform usage, the collected data shows that users entering as a guest and those entering through their crypto wallet are almost evenly split, with an average of 49 % and 51% respectively. However, the data shows a slight trend towards wallet users following the launch. Lastly, with an overwhelming majority, 95 % of users accessed the scene through Decentraland’s web application, while only 5% utilised the client.The development and launch of the white-label metaverse solution represent a new frontier for Worldline. As the solution is the company's first commercial venture into the metaverse, the development of the solution, brought with it several unknowns. While it was discussed which companies to target most effectively, the lack of precedence left it unclear which companies were interested in this kind of solution and how they would want to utilise the virtual space offered to them. The launch of the solution provided valuable data and insights into the type of customer segment interested in this solution. The findings showcased in the previous section suggest that the solution can help non-IT companies, which lack the time and know-how to develop a solution of their own, establish a presence in the metaverse. Additionally, in terms of company size, the results suggest that SMEs could be a main target segment, which comes back to the aspect of limited resources. Another interesting finding was the lack of in-store payments. None of the stores utilised payment links and opted to redirect customers to their existing payment channels. While the lack of in-store payment could be down to the transaction fees charged by Worldline, it could also indicate that companies currently view the metaverse as an advertisement and marketing channel, which funnels customers to their more mature sales channels and helps create positive publicity by profiting off the metaverse hype. While brands see value in the white-label solution, it is unclear whether consumers see any appeal in this kind of virtual experience, as suggested by the low user numbers. However, the user statistics collected as part of this thesis are too limited to draw any conclusion. What the limited data does suggest, is that users who enter the mall are willing to spend considerable time within the mall, as suggested by the average time spent in the scene of 19 minutes. Furthermore, the total user numbers are hard to interpret, as these statistics are not publicly available. As such there are no reference values from other Decentraland scenes, which could be used as a basis for comparison. Further research could examine how user statistics develop over time, to find out how much consumers demand virtual shopping experiences.While the launch of the solution was an initial success, the focus of this thesis is on the implementation of the solution. Developing on the Decentraland platform was an enjoyable yet challenging experience. The challenges in this project were mainly present due to a lack of prior experience with the platform and more specifically the game development design patterns it utilises. While the ECS architecture offers a lot of modularity, there is a learning curve for developers accustomed to an object-oriented approach. This is not helped by the lack of proper documentation for the Decentraland SDK. While Decentraland does provide thorough documentation for some aspects of the SDK others are only covered sparingly. It is thus highly recommended to make use of all additional resources provided by the Decentraland community, such as the Awesome Repository and the Decentraland Discord channel. Furthermore, the challenge associated with creating virtual experiences also lies in the broad skill set it demands. In contrast to mere development, a considerable amount of time was dedicated to creating and editing 3D models as well as the design of graphic textures using tools such as Blender and Inkscape. Regarding the solution development, the process was initiated with a thorough requirements analysis. While the majority of requirements could be identified through the analysis and initial test, other requirements, such as the need for resource management and adjustments to the product modules, had to be added during the development process. Scene management in particular was an essential aspect of the solution and enabled a more controllable and intelligent allocation of scene resources. While originally intended to manage the scenes resources, it can be expanded in the future to manage even more sub-scenes, which can be included in the mall building or swapped with the entire mall scene through certain user actions. In conclusion, this bachelor thesis set out with the question of how metaverse platforms such as Decentraland can be utilised to create and implement virtual shopping spaces. To tackle this research question a literature review was conducted to establish a solid theoretical understanding of fundamental questions concerning the metaverse, virtual world development concepts, the emerging v-commerce channel, and the increasing supply of virtual shopping experiences. While the term metaverse is widely used by many businesses and platforms, it currently lacks a proper definition, with many researchers struggling to agree upon the metaverse's non-negotiable aspects, such as the use of VR or the interoperability been virtual worlds. Meanwhile, many companies have invested in the creation of virtual spaces, with the intent to monetize these. The creation of such spaces has been facilitated by virtual platforms such as Roblox and Decentraland, which lower the entree barrier by offering users integrated content creation tools. To address the research question, a virtual shopping mall solution was developed for the metaverse platform Decentraland. This solution aimed to offer customers a virtual white-label store, which they are able to configure using their branding and the products and advertising elements they want to display. The design of this solution required an initial requirements analysis, which was used to define the immersive technology, interface, performance, intelligence, and function requirements of the solution. While additional requirements had to be added as development started, all requirements were implemented within the set timeframe. Through the implementation process, it was found that the aspects of scene resource management and modular design were crucial in building a content-rich solution that was nevertheless easy to maintain, scale and which adheres to the resource limitations set by Decentraland. To provide users visiting the mall with a sense of presence, numerous atmospheric elements were included in the solution design, including a modern design with futuristically themed features, navigational elements, music, and video inside stores, as well as a plethora of product presentation options, aimed to increase the authenticity and responsiveness of virtual products. The implementation was followed by the successful launch of the solution with a total of eight customers renting a store within the mall. The initial success of the solution suggests that especially small to medium-sized companies are interested in such a solution, which allows them to quickly set up a shop in the metaverse to explore this new channel. However, none of the tenants were willing to accept payment from within the platform. Furthermore, limited user statistics imply that consumers who visit the virtual space are willing to spend up to 22 minutes within virtual shopping spaces. However, in terms of user numbers, the initial demand was low, with only 145 users visiting the mall over the first three weeks. The project thesis on hand “Shopping Experiences in the Metaverse – Implementation of a White Label Metaverse Solution” was written during a three-month period while working within the Metaverse and Crypto Competence Centre at the company Worldline. Due to the limited time and scope, this thesis is only based on the implementation of the Worldline white-label metaverse solution and its launch. Due to the lack of time, only limited data could be collected following the launch of the solution. Going forward, further user statistics will be collected to get a better understanding of how many monthly users the solution can attract. Furthermore, the project experienced a setback with the loss of one of its developers during the first month of development. This loss caused an increase in workload, resulting in the postponement of additional non-functional, including plans to implement gamification elements on the event floor of the mall, which would have been covered as part of this thesis.I have written the project thesis on hand “Shopping Experiences in the Metaverse – Implementing a White Label Metaverse Solution” independently and have used no sources other than those specified.I have indicated the thoughts adopted directly or indirectly from other sources at the appropriate places within the document. \n"

process of develop a white label shopping mall solution to offer brand easy access to the metaverse through customizable store space the scope of this research include the initial requirement analysis follow by the implementation and launch of the solution throughout the development process multiple requirement such as resource management modular design and payment integration be identify and implement additionally various store atmospheric element be utilise in the design of the user interface the result solution be successfully launch and be able to attract eight customer who lease a store within the mall furthermore the mall be visit by 145 user within the first three week follow the launch \\n the metaverse be here and it ’s not only transform how we see the world but how we participate in it whether one count themselves as an avid follower of emerge technology or not it be safe to say that the term metaverse have reach mainstream audience and have have a polarising effect on consumer and business alike with company such as Facebook rename themselves to Meta   and seemingly bet the company ’s entire future on the success of the metaverse the interest and hype surround this emerge technology have see a meteoric rise throughout the past year however with company race to integrate the metaverse into their strategy there appear to be a considerable amount of scepticism and confusion surround the topic search the term on Google one will quickly find an abundance of article with title that go along the line of what exactly be the metaverse while consumer seem to be confuse by the concept other even interpret current metaverse development as a mere fad at well and see it as the new marketing buzzword the confusion and scepticism surround the metaverse seem to stem from the general vagueness about basic fact such as what the metaverse be what it will offer and when it will arrive as there be currently no universally accept definition of what a metaverse be and the fact that the metaverse be use as an umbrella term combine various technology such as blockchain virtual reality digital twin artificial intelligence and more it be currently hard to classify what be and what be not a metaverse as well as what use case it will have while these point be criticise metaverse advocate often argue that they be a normal part of the development of major technological innovation and will often point to the initial vagueness and scepticism surround the internet in its early day no matter what side of the debate one be on the metaverse promise to provide consumer and company with new and exciting possibility in numerous industry while look at various use case this thesis will mainly explore the metaverse potential as a platform for create immersive shopping and advertising experience as consumer commerce have increasingly shift from traditional brick and mortar business to e commerce in the past decade the metaverse offer business yet another possibility to reach their customer online while provide they with a 3d experience that be more akin to a physical store than a two dimensional website this thesis will analyse the current state of this field of study and show a practical example of how metaverse shopping experience can be implement    with the emergence of the metaverse as a new digital channel more and more company be look at way to take their brand into the metaverse and offer consumer an immersive digital shopping experience as such this thesis will explore how company can leverage metaverse platform to create 3d shopping space and experience for consumer to examine the possibility the metaverse offer the research question will be examine from both a theoretical as well a practical point of view firstly to establish some theoretical groundwork and clear up possible confusion surround the metaverse a literature review will be conduct the review literature will be use to explain some of the basic metaverse concept and technology and cover the platform that offer metaverse experience today additionally the review will take a close look at the type of shopping experience the metaverse can offer what type of experience be already available and which factor impact these lastly as the basis for the practical part of this thesis the review will cover various aspect relate to the development process of 3d space within the metaverse the literature review will be follow by the main part which will be practical and will follow the implementation of a white label metaverse solution at the company Worldline this section will explain various aspect of the solution but will mainly concentrate on the technical implementation of the solution and cover how the define requirement be implement what challenge be face and how these be meet lastly the development process and the result solution will be analyse and critically assess before conclude the thesis see as the metaverse be a subject that be still new to many people this literature review will start by examine some of the basic question such as what the metaverse be how it work as well as the type of application it can be use for additionally some key concept and term will be explain and define use opinion from various academic source with these basic cover the review will focus on the shopping commerce use case of the metaverse and analyse the metaverse 's role as a sale channel and determine which factor influence the consumer ’s experience lastly this section will end by review several option for develop on metaverse platform and go through some of the key concept relate to the development of virtual world while the idea of a metaverse might seem very new and advanced to most people the concept and idea behind the metaverse have exist for far long than most would believe the metaverse first mention can be date back to the year 1992 when the term be coin by science fiction author Neal Stephenson in his book Snow Crash the book describe a dystopian future in which humanity spend much of its time in a virtual world refer to as the metaverse which be access through the use of virtual reality device and where people in the form of avatar seek entertainment and do many of the thing they would like to do in the physical world while there currently exist no universally accept definition of what the metaverse be different academic source generally agree that at a basic level the metaverse be a three dimensional virtual world in which user be able to interact with each other the development of virtual space and world in which user can spend their time can be trace back to the 1970 and have be heavily influence by the gaming industry as well as various work of science fiction the development have since go through many stage and have lead to the release of the first commercial virtual world such as Second Life which be release in 2003 since these early day more and more virtual world platform have be release and have find mainstream success with modern platform such as Roblox see 150 million monthly active user MAU enter their virtual space as with previous advance in the field new technological concept and advance have be the main driving force behind these new platform and the increase interest in they today ’s virtual world be build on state of the art technology from various domain such as artificial intelligence AI blockchain virtual augmented reality edge computing digital twin etc that be gradually form these platform into the metaverse as envision in various work of science fiction it be also these advancement in technology that have lead to the metaverse gain mainstream appeal while virtual space be for a long time consider as place for young cohort to play video game recent advance have lead many industry to consider how they can leverage the metaverse for their business model it be now believe that all major industry such as health care consumer product entertainment and business to business technical solution to payment   will in some way be influence by the metaverse the domain of virtual commerce have be at the forefront of the commercialization of virtual world apparel company like Nike and Gucci as well as other luxury fashion brand have show big interest in the metaverse and have establish a presence in various virtual world platform where they promote their brand and sell physical but also purely digital version of their product various source attribute the grow interest in virtual space not just for entertainment but also for numerous commercial purpose at least partially to the restriction of the Covid-19 pandemic which lead many to flee into the virtual world to find some source of human interaction while they be force to stay within the confine of their home however while company try to leverage the metaverse and the excitement surround it be ever grow it be important to remember that the metaverse remain without a clear definition additionally most platform today that refer to themselves as the metaverse do not meet the propose criterion that many metaverse researcher have lay out for a complete metaverse mainly the aspect of interoperability or interconnectedness as such there remain a lot of confusion about the metaverse as mention in the section above academic literature currently do not offer an agree upon definition of what a metaverse be the lack of a proper definition for the metaverse be see as problematic and even harmful to its future development   and have lead to a division between those that believe the metaverse to be a technology of the future not yet achieve and those that believe that current solution already satisfy the requirement of a metaverse however while the metaverse remain undefined the number of compete definition I grow quickly find a suitable definition have be the main topic of numerous metaverse research paper   and have lead to many paper start with the author coin their definition or align with another researcher ’s definition for the sake of clarity   table 1 showcase five metaverse definition from research paper use as part of this literature review while some of these definition mention various technology such as AR and VR as part of their definition the common denominator between each be that they define the metaverse as be a virtual world although this be seemingly the most widely accept fact about the metaverse it be also the root of many divergent opinion particularly regard whether the metaverse have already be achieve if the metaverse be a virtual world what characteristic make it different from just be a virtual world virtual world be define by   as virtual world be persistent online computer generate environment where multiple user in remote physical location can interact in real time for the purpose of work or play the development of virtual world precede the metaverse and can be trace back to the creation of multi user dungeon MUD in the 1970 since then the development of virtual world have be categorise into five distinct phase start from the 1970 and lead up to the present day the five phase of development be characterise by a constant advance in computational power culminate in the first commercially use virtual world such as Second Life which be release in 2003 by Linden Lab and have develop an in game economy value at usd 500 million by the year 2015 additionally the development be characterise by a constant shift which see virtual world move away from their initial focus on gaming characterise by world offer predefine goal activity and a linear experience to space more akin to the real world that offer little to no predefine activity rely mainly on user generate content UGC and offer an open end experience although the scope of virtual world be now far great than just gaming it be interesting to note that its influence can still be see in the terminology use when discuss they whereas regular online platform refer to their customer as user virtual world have player who be play while the user experience and activity be refer to as the gameplay current metaverse development fall into the fifth phase of virtual world development which mark the transition from virtual world to the metaverse while there be not a clear consensus of what aspect will characterise this transition many researcher see the aspect of interoperability and blend reality to be the central innovation that the metaverse will bring to virtual world interoperability often also call interconnectedness refer to the move from single virtual space to connect virtual world between which player and asset can move without restriction or loss of datum Dionisio et al   describe this development as a succession of state that transition from single virtual world refer to as MetaWorlds to MetaGalaxies which combine multiple virtual world under a single authority to a complete metaverse combine both MetaWorlds and Galaxies as part of a decentralised network use standard protocol to allow complete interoperability even though the aspect of interoperability be mostly accept other researcher see the combination of the physical and virtual world as the main metaverse driver such view focus heavily on the interface use to interact with the metaverse such as VR and AR Dwivedi et al go as far as say any metaverse can not exist without AR and/or VR which disqualify many of the current virtual world as be a metaverse however even though AR and VR be often quote as be central building block of the metaverse other researcher do not see these technology as be mandatory overall as the hype surround the metaverse grow certain aspect of the metaverse remain unclear with researcher take different stance on which aspect will be part of the metaverse and which will not as new metaverse platform emerge the need for a clear cut definition be become increasingly urgent although researcher can not yet agree on an exact definition this have not keep they from discuss what the metaverse of the future will look like and which innovation will pave the way with the metaverse set to bring innovation and new possibility to almost every industry it should not come as a surprise that the technology stack on which the metaverse be build be rather complex current research try to establish an architecture for the metaverse which have result in the creation of several model that try to organise individual building block logically this section will be use to review approach find in current research and evaluate how these compare to each other additionally some of the core technology will be highlight to clarify their application within the metaverse technology stack the metaverse connect many of today ’s cutting edge technology and have thus turn into an interdisciplinary topic try to create a more holistic view of the metaverse various research paper try to organise technological as well as non technological dimension into a single structure such structure be generally refer to as architecture layer or Components of the metaverse while these model do not align perfectly with each other most of they propose a layered structure   propose a thorough model which not only define distinct layer but also map the relevant technology for the metaverse to be fully realise it will rely on various technology and will have to consider different aspect of the metaverse ecosystem Lee et al organise these factor into 14 focus area that will support the creation and usage of the metaverse as figure 1 show the propose structure define a technology and ecosystem layer which group element start with fundamental building block such as infrastructure and avatar and continuous with the technology and ecosystem aspect that build on top of these the model be in essence a roadmap for the metaverse show the technological innovation the metaverse require from the technological perspective and open decision about how to handle various aspect of the metaverse ecosystem .Other researcher have opt for similar layered approach but have put less emphasis on the concrete technology that these contain Duan et al propose a similar layered architecture which place component in an infrastructure interaction and ecosystem layer this approach focus on the convergence of the physical and virtual world with the infrastructure and ecosystem layer contain component that be purely physical or digital respectively while the intersection layer contain element such as digital twin and content creation interface that create the connection between the physical and digital world similarly there have be attempt to use the OSI reference model as the basis for a standardised metaverse model this approach see the data flow and application layer define by the OSI model adapt into the infrastructure layer make up of the device communication cloud and virtual cloud layer and the metaverse layer contain the datum space digital twin and perception layer the author claim that having decouple layer as with the OSI reference model will give each layer more freedom in its development as mention before there be currently no standardised model or architecture for the metaverse however the propose model mention above show many similarity while each model differ to some degree researcher seem to agree on a layered approach which try to separate physical from virtual factor and see computing and network infrastructure as its fundamental building block as figure 1 show the metaverse be build on top of many of today ’s most innovative technology this section will offer a short overview of the main technology that be part of the metaverse technology stack and explain how these be drive metaverse development as well as their current limitation Game Engines as the metaverse will be a or many virtual world(s at its core game engine be an essential part of the creation process game engine have traditionally be use in the development of video game they be essentially a platform or framework in which developer can create virtual space without have to implement basic feature from the ground up basic feature include graphic rendering physics engine lighting system and collision detection which be require for almost any virtual world by offer these fundamental piece developer be able to dedicate more time to create actual feature that will improve their product while big game developer typically build their own in house game engine the majority of today ’s video game be develop on pre build engine the market for such pre build solution be dominate by the open source solution Unity develop by Unity Technologies and the Unreal engine by Epic Games with the increase demand for virtual space in industry such as manufacturing public planning and the film industry these platform have find new use case that go well beyond the creation of video game and which have turn Unity Technologies and Epic Games into influential player within the metaverse space as they offer the platform use to create these virtual space virtual and Augmented reality virtual reality VR and augment reality AR be believe to be the primary interface through which user experience the metaverse both technology represent two separate end of the so call reality Virtuality Continuum immerse oneself in VR or AR require the use of a headset or head mount display in the case of VR the user be block off from the outside world and fully immerse inside the virtual space AR on the other hand overlay virtual asset onto the physical world let the user experience the real world through a see through display both VR and AR be part of the great extend Reality XR family which also include Mixed Reality a mix between AR and VR which be however not clearly define as of yet the immersive potential that VR and AR offer can be apply for use case such as simulation gaming work marketing and education   however while these technology be very promising they still have to overcome some technological challenge these challenge primarily pertain to the limited field of view FOV and resolution that current headset provide to give user the impression of full immersion VR headset have to mimic the human visual range which require a FOV of 200 ° x 130 ° while current display can get close to this visual range it require the use of display with at least 6 k horizontal resolution make such headset extremely expensive additionally there be the problem of motion sickness which be a phenomenon many user experience while use VR headset that cause feeling of nausea and dizziness even though this side effect be well know current research have not be able to find its exact cause .blockchain Blockchain be a ledger technology that store datum in virtual block each block of datum reference the previous and next block thus create a link of block refer to as a chain this data structure be store on all node participate in the blockchain network make the network completely decentralise additionally a new block can only be add through a so call consensus algorithm which force all node to agree on the validity of a newly add block in combination these technique lead to a system that be almost impossible to manipulate or control while remain completely decentralised Blockchain be first introduce through the Bitcoin Network but have since find multiple new use case state of the art blockchain such as Ethereum be not just able to manage digital payment but can also store code make it possible to deploy decentralise application smart contract and track non interchangeable digital asset refer to as non fungible token NFT the addition of the latter two concept have open the door for blockchain to be the basis for the virtual economy inside the metaverse offer the secure tracking of virtual asset through the use of nft and the management of transaction through smart contract while also provide the basis for decentralised data storage current virtual world platform such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels already use nft and smart contract as a way for player to own and sell virtual land and asset that be immutably track by the Ethereum blockchain Decentraland have even go a step far and create a Decentralised Autonomous Organization DAO through the use of smart contract this organisation vote on issue include land and estate feature marketplace fee etc which all community member can participate in however the possibility offer by blockchain technology have also give rise to new debate and concern with virtual asset become persistent and trackable question have emerge about how these asset should be view from a legal point of view and whether they count as legal object on the technical side blockchain be still struggle with transaction time as every transaction have to be validate by the consensus algorithm the transaction can only be see as complete once the algorithm be finish and the transaction have be append to the chain this do not allow for the typical fast transaction time and more research be require to find way to speed up the consensus mechanism .Artificial intelligence Artificial Intelligence AI be an umbrella term for all technology that enable machine to learn think and behave like human do state of the art AI technique include machine learning reinforcement learning and deep learning which have numerous application inside and outside of the metaverse one of the main use case for AI inside the metaverse will be control non player character npc npc be any agent within a virtual world that be not control by a human such character be use to interact with user in the form of assistant enemy or character in a story ai power npc which will be train through customer interaction will be especially important for the purpose of consumer interaction offer user unique interaction researcher be expect AI power npc to play a big role in the metaverse and predict that the majority of interaction will not be human to human but human to AI while the potential for AI be very promising the model on which these application run be complex and resource intensive make they unfit for mobile device    Edge Computing run a virtual world require a vast amount of compute resource to simulate the world 's physic collision etc old virtual world such as Second Life have use centralised server often in the cloud for such computational effort with increase datum and computational demand this approach can limit the number of user in a certain space and cause latency issue edge computing be employ as a solution to this problem it address the latency issue by distribute compute resource and datum storage close to the end user as latency be one of the primary influence on a user ’s sense of immersion minimise it be extremely important mobile device such as headset and smartphone which will be the main gateway into the metaverse heavily rely on the offloading of computational task and will be the main benefactor of edge compute .Although many aspect of the metaverse remain unclear and be still in development numerous platform such as Roblox Decentraland and the Sandbox have emerge which offer user the possibility of take part in a share virtual world within the last two year the number of mobile app that have add metaverse to their description or name have drastically grow such platform often advertise themselves as be part of the metaverse however some researcher point out that they do not meet all the criterion to be refer to as such without a general definition of the metaverse it be almost impossible to differentiate which platform be part of the metaverse and which be not despite this there have be attempt to categorise the current metaverse platform base on various dimension the propose model place platform into one of four category base on two or more dimension Kshetri propose a model which classify metaverse platform base on the type of interface they offer and whether their economy be decentralise or not in term of the interface the model distinguish between 2D and 3d world two dimensional virtual space be be utilise in platform such as Gather Town which specialise in collaboration within virtual space as well as decentralised social game meanwhile the aspect of decentralisation through the use of blockchain technology be much more debate as some see decentralisation as a foundational feature of the metaverse while other believe it to be a technology which can be use if need decentralization through blockchain be primarily use in platform that include a virtual economy this way secure transaction and ownership can be handle through NFTs and smart contract however not all use case require blockchain technology virtual space specialize in the simulation of real world activity such as education or medical operation put their focus on immersive aspect often through the use of VR and AR and do not need virtual economy system an alternative classification be create by the non profit organisation Acceleration Studios as part of their metaverse roadmap this approach define two axis result in 4 quadrant each define a metaverse category   the axis define by the model differentiate whether the utilise technology result in an external or intimate experience and a simulated or augmented experience as figure 2 show the horizontal axis differentiate between intimate experience which incorporate the user ’s virtual action into the virtual world and external experience which incorporate action from the physical world into the digital world the vertical axis on the other side distinguish whether technology be use to bring virtual asset into the real world or simulate the physical world within the virtual world the combination of the two axis result in four distinct metaverse type Augmented Reality Worlds which add virtual asset to the physical world Mirror Worlds simulate aspect of the physical world within a virtual space Life Logging in which aspect of the physical world be send to a virtual space to be track and lastly Virtual Worlds offer user a virtual space completely separate from the physical world in which they can immerse themselves .The follow section will focus on the metaverse as a means to create shopping experience to participate in the newly emerge field of virtual commerce to provide a holistic overview the section will begin with the fundamental of the metaverse sale channel examine what it offer and how it compare to other channel mainly traditional e commerce furthermore as numerous organisation be look to create immersive experience in the metaverse researcher have be evaluate which factor influence the virtual shopping experience and how virtual space should be design for the optimal experience the finding of these study will be explain and compare lastly some of the most notable virtual shopping experience that be currently available will be showcase this will serve to show some practical example allow for a comparison of aspect such as offer product the type of virtual environment and the virtual world platform the company have choose as user spend an increase amount of their time in virtual space virtual platform have see an increase in transaction between user who sell and buy through such platform the act of participate in commerce within virtual world be refer to as virtual commerce and be define as electronically mediate commercial transaction that originate from an alternate reality technological platform and involve either digitally generate or real world product and service de Regt and Barnes 2019 p. 19 this new form of commerce be abbreviate as v commerce by many source cf de Regt and Barnes p. 20 2019 cf Hofman Kohlmeyer 2017 p. 176 cf Martínez Navarro et al 2019 p. 475 however other research also refer to it as metaverse commerce cf Lee et al 2021 p. 34 or VR shopping cf Xi and Hamari 2021 p. 46 the emergence of v commerce have in great part be enable by recent advance in immersive technology such as VR AR and virtual world that allow for the simulation of immersive virtual space cf Shen et al 2021 p. 3 company be utilise these technology to create new virtual channel in which they can demonstrate product hold event and interact with their customer to create new product user can access these space through numerous VR interface include regular pc monitor smartphone connect to VR headset head mount display and more cf Martínez Navarro et al 2019 p. 476 AR on the other hand see usage in try on style application that enable the customer to interact with a virtual version of a product before they buy it and which have become popular within the retail sector cf de Regt and Barnes 2019 pp 21 22 additionally the incorporation of blockchain technology such as nft have be one of the main factor enable the market for digital asset as nft make digital asset unique and their quantity can be limit by their creator their scarcity generate value if demand for they exist furthermore common token standard such as ERC721 have enable the interoperability of NFTs which allow they to be transfer between different virtual space the aspect of interoperability be a big departure from traditional virtual asset which have always be restrict to their particular space cf Momtaz 2022 p. 228 these technological innovation have open the path for shopping and general commerce within the metaverse v commerce as a channel promise to solve problem relate to time and space cf Xi and Hamari 2021 p. 37 and provide new possibility for create immersive experience cf de Regt and Barnes 2019 p. 20 which other digital channel lack cf Hofman Kohlmeyer 2017 p. 178 within virtual space store owner can display product without take up any physical space similar to current e commerce solution however as oppose to 2D image customer view product in an immersive manner that be close to the experience provide by traditional brick and mortar store cf Martínez Navarro et al 2019 p. 476 Research have show that the use of engage virtual space can generate affect a profound sense of presence and increase other cognitive response that enhance business performance such as brand recall which impact on purchase intention cf Martínez Navarro et al 2019 p. 481 at the same time such space offer a much great degree of accessibility as they be available at all time and from all place cf Xi and Hamari 2021 p. 37 as such the v commerce sale channel place itself between traditional e commerce channel and brick and mortar store combine the convenience that come with a digital experience while still offer immersion and a sense of presence at its heart v commerce be a form of digital commerce it be thus worthwhile to discuss how it differentiate itself and compare to traditional e commerce e commerce be define as the advertising sale and distribution of product and service through the internet network depend on the role of the selling and buy party as either a business consumer or government e commerce can far be divide into type such as Business to Consumer B2C business to Business B2B government to Business G2B etc utilise the internet as a channel for commerce have allow business to increase their reach and offer customer a service that be available to they at all time this have allow business to use time more effectively while also reduce expense for physical store however e commerce business tend to see a much high number of refund as customer can not try the product before the purchase in sum this lead to e commerce catering to customer that value convenience over social and atmospheric aspect as well as young demographic that be accustomed to the internet as the metaverse present another digital channel next to e commerce it be natural to question how these channel relate to each other and if they offer compete experience within the v commerce literature its relationship to e commerce be not extensively cover some author see v commerce as a subset of the great e commerce genre which distinguish itself from other form of e commerce through its virtual interface the 3d interface and the possibility it offer have however lead other to see v commerce as the evolution of e commerce while it be not clear how v commerce should exactly fit into the e commerce typology the exist literature have widely cover how the shopping experience between these two vary these comparison mainly focus on the aspect of provide shopping value as well as the use of technology shopping experience can offer various kind of value to a shopper the value a shopping experience provide be classify as either a hedonic or utilitarian shopping value utilitarian shopping value be non emotional and be create when the shopping transaction include the acquisition of information as well as buy the product be convenient and efficient in contrast hedonic shopping value focus on the emotional value an experience can provide   through multisensory fantasy and emotive aspect of consumption research on shopping value focus on the relationship between hedonic and utilitarian aspect and their influence on the so call critical outcome variable critical outcome variable include satisfaction with the retailer word of mouth re patronage anticipation and re patronage intention research on these argue that only re patronage intention be mainly influence by utilitarian factor while other outcome variable rely on hedonic value compare the e commerce and v commerce shopping experience under these aspect e commerce shopping mainly offer utilitarian value as it offer customer the convenience of shop independent from time and location while also provide easy to access product information such as description and review however the shopping experience in term of excitement and stimulation be very limited compare to traditional in store shopping while still a digital channel v commerce provide customer with an experience that be unique and interactive thus it cater to experience orient customer that be look for an interactive shopping experience   that provide hedonic shopping value the difference in provide shopping value show that these channel do not necessarily compete for the same target audience as consumer look for a hedonic experience will favour an immersive shop in the metaverse while customer that prefer a straightforward and efficient shopping transaction will opt for the traditional two dimensional website in this vein multiple researcher be advocate for company to pursue a multi- or omnichannel approach such an approach would see v commerce activity be integrate with exist e commerce structure and ensure that customer be able to choose the experience that offer the shopping value they desire go on from the provide shopping value shop in virtual space far differentiate itself from a technological point of view in term of technological difference the correlation between the technological intensity of an experience and the possibility for co creation it offer have be a topic of study for researcher Buhalis et al suggest that possibility for co creation through personalisation customisation etc increase with the technological intensity of an experience additionally it be argue that experience build on the metaverse VR and AR have a fundamentally different relationship to technology compare to less technology intense experience such as those offer through traditional website for the latter technology assist co creation while it be a prerequisite for an experience build use virtual technology with company show increase interest in use the metaverse as a channel to provide immersive shopping experience the question of how such experience can be create be become more relevant while interest in v commerce be high than ever the concept of use virtual world for commercial purpose have be try in various virtual space such as Second Life in the mid to late 2000s as such virtual shopping experience have be study by various researcher throughout the last decade this section will seek to find the factor influence virtual shopping by evaluate various research result the review literature include paper that examine current metaverse platform as well as early virtual world before examine some of the factor influence virtual shopping it be worthwhile to look at typical feature and aspect that be find in current v commerce space a study by Xi and Hamari   review 72 academic source on virtual shopping to find out what kind of shopping experience be be create use virtual reality the study capture various aspect of the virtual world it review include the type of simulate environment the type of product be offer which input output device be use and other aspect the review find that 37.35 of virtual retail environment be use to create single retail store follow by supermarket 16.87 and product shelf 16.87 meanwhile virtual shopping mall be only find in 4.82 of the review literature in term of product food and non alcoholic beverage be display most commonly 30.12 follow by mixed product 20.48 and clothing 14.48 lastly head mount display be the by far the most use interface device with a usage rate of 65.05 while regular pc monitor find the least usage with only 14.43 it be however questionable whether such a major preference for head mount display over monitor would also be find among regular consumer as they present a substantial investment a british study on the acceptance of v commerce have show that only 25 of participant would be willing to pay £ 200 for a head mount display while 30 would pay £ 15 £ 80 and 20 of participant be not willing to spend any money on they meanwhile comparison between numerous interface device have show that head mount display offer customer the good experience and generate a well consumer response in turn .With the metaverse establish itself as a new and attractive sale channel an increase amount of research have focus on the creation of experience that be worthwhile to consumer this research mainly take place within the closely relate field of consumer behaviour and application design which study the effect that certain design element have on consumer as well as the response that they trigger consumer behaviour research use the consumer purchase model to divide a consumer ’s purchasing decision into five logical step which start with the problem definition follow by an information search evaluation of alternative the purchase decision and the post purchase evaluation the most critical stage within this model be the purchase decision within consumer behaviour research the metric most closely equate to a purchasing decision be purchase intention which be define as the \\n strength of consumer ’s willingness to buy a particular product service or product and \\n service from a particular brand as such numerous research paper have study how virtual shopping space affect a consumer ’s purchase intention and have try to isolate the influence factor as mention early one of the main advantage of a virtual shopping space be the sense of presence it give to the consumer use the space the effect of this phenomenon on consumer response be evaluate in a 2019 study that compare consumer response in virtual and physical store the study conclude that the sense of presence positively impact consumer purchase intention as well as brand recall which in turn also drive purchase intention additionally presence be predominantly influence by the emotion participant feel within the virtual space look at far influence factor the two main determinant for presence in virtual world be its vividness and the degree of interactivity vividness relate to the visual representation of the space include any kind of sensory cue as well as how well these be present similarly Cummings and Bailenson describe the formation of presence as be achieve in a two step process in which user evaluate whether the visual representation of the space be realistic as well as whether they can act with the environment .The look and feel as well as the layout of shopping space for traditional physical store be extensively study in the past such study have examine the effect of sensory element such as sight hearing and touch which fall under the collective term of atmospheric the finding of this research be be use by current metaverse study which try to evaluate how store atmospheric translate from physical to virtual retail space atmospheric be extremely important to any form of retail research on online atmospheric show that its influence on purchase decision be strong compare to in store shopping   and be essential for create engage virtual community atmospheric factor have traditionally be classify into non visual ambient factor e.g. music and lighting visual design factor which can serve either a functional or aesthetic purpose and social factor which include any type of human interaction within the store with the move from in store and 2D online commerce to v commerce multiple author have attempt to create an update or entirely new typology of influence factor while some of the evaluate study focus specifically on atmospheric other examine the virtual shopping experience as a whole Wu et al   perform a study include 170 undergraduate participant and evaluate virtual retail store create by the participant in a 3d modelling software this method be use to identify and classify atmospheric design choice and element the study conclude that atmospheric element could be classify into pathfinde assistance feature environment feature or as product presentation feature table 2 present an overview of select feature for each of the 3 atmospheric category furthermore in term of effective design the author suggest the incorporation of multiple feature per category but also note that an excess amount could lead to consumer experience information overload additionally they highlight the effectiveness as well as the necessity for pathfinde feature which ease the navigation of the store and help to maintain user engagement whereas this study offer three broad category other researcher propose a more detailed classification by analyse 27 virtual store in the metaverse platform Second Life Hassouneh and Brengman   find that virtual store characteristic can be categorise into 9 category which be the macro environment store exterior store layout interior aesthetic design factor store ambient factor point of purchase customer service social factor and entertainment factor use these category to compare virtual and physical store the research find that in term of atmospheric virtual store borrow much more from physical store than from 2D website however compare to physical store store interior element be often use for entertainment as oppose to functionality or aesthetic furthermore product presentation be greatly impact by the space available to the retailer while small store display product as two dimensional image which take up less space big store tend to display product as 3d model look beyond atmospheric additional research have focus on virtual store layout and how these compare to the layout utilise in physical store commonly use retail store layout include the grid racetrack and freeform layout the layout a store implement have be show to influence the shopping experience and as such layout choice be very much dependent on what the store sell Grid layout which offer easy navigation be often use for store in which customer demand utilitarian value such as grocery store freeform layout on the other hand be perceive as the most pleasant entertaining and stimulate layout by consumer consequently freeform layout have be identify as the ideal layout for virtual store as they complement the hedonic nature of virtual shopping experience while the above mention study focus on internal factor influence the shopping experience other study have focus on or include external factor as v commerce present a new technology to the majority of user technology acceptance factor such as change in shopping behaviour perceive convenience and consumer attitude towards new technology play an influence role on the shopping experience research on the acceptance of v commerce have show that next to shopping value age be one of the main determinant for technology acceptance Younger 18 34 technology aware consumer be more motivated to partake in virtual shopping than old consumer who feel less inclined to give up their shopping habit additionally v commerce ’s role as a new and novelty experience be one of the main motivation for consumer to try virtual shopping which could result in a loss of motivation once the novelty effect wear off as in physical retail the number of external and internal factor influence consumer behaviour be quite large through a systematic literature review Shen et al have create a list of 15 external and internal factor which ultimately influence the consumer purchase decision while more extensive the factor overlap with those name by more interestingly the identify model be use to propose a reference model of design artefact and requirement for v commerce application the researcher propose a model consist of 5 distinct requirement which include the type of immersive technology use the design of the interface efficient performance intelligent automation and functional aspect each requirement can be map to various design artefact that influence purchase intention example of which can be see in figure 5 the model offer a starting point for business build v commerce application as well as a basis for researcher to evaluate they .To conclude this section the follow part will give a brief overview of some of the metaverse shopping experience that be already available to consumer the metaverse be become an increasingly attractive channel for organisation the viability of virtualize one ’s business have in great part be influence by the circumstance of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restriction that come with it apparel company have be one of the first mover in the attempt to virtualize one of the major brand to enter the metaverse be the american sport brand Nike who release NIKELAND on the virtual world platform Roblox in September of 2021 which have since be visit by over 31 million user NIKELAND represent a virtual version of Nike ’s real life headquarter campus within the virtual space user can explore the virtual headquarter collect item and join match of various sport theme game most importantly however user be able to interact with virtual version of Nike ’s apparel such as sneaker which their avatar can wear and which Nike can monetize in the form of nft three month after the release of NIKELAND Nike acquire RTFKT studio a company specialize in virtual apparel and item far cement their dedication to the metaverse price for Nike ’s virtual sneaker currently range between usd 248 8.647 on the NFT marketplace OpenSea .While Nike be a very prominent example they be neither the only nor the first brand to go virtual in April 2021 urban apparel brand Vans release their virtual skateboard park Vans World the space be build on the Roblox platform and have be visit over 92 million time to date similarly to NIKELAND Vans World try to engage user through game in the form of a skating park game when user be not play they can purchase virtual van apparel within the virtual store within the apparel segment luxury fashion brand whose product be centre around prestige and hedonic value   have display a high degree of interest in v commerce specifically the sale of nft italian fashion brand Gucci have be among the front runner within the luxury fashion segment in 2021 the brand open a virtual replica of their Gucci Garden for 2 week within Roblox where user could buy virtual accessory such as handbag while these item be sell for usd 1.20 9 one handbag later resold for the equivalent of usd 4,115 715 more than its real life counterpart   furthermore the brand have announce another limited time experience call Gucci Vault on the virtual world platform the Sandbox where user will fulfil objective and take part in raffle with the chance to win virtual item the metaverse be however not restrict to apparel brand represent consumer electronic korean company Samsung release its 837X experience store on the Decentraland platform in January of 2022 the space which be base on Samsung ’s 837 experience store in New York City consist of a virtual theatre stage and forest section user visit the space can earn nft by complete objective and be able to experience various art fashion and music influence furthermore financial institution such as the german capital investment company Deka who have open a virtual information hub in Decentraland or ING who have build a virtual city within Roblox be also represent in the metaverse as the above example showcase the metaverse be draw attention from various company and industry as the clothing and accessory product translate very well from physical to virtual world apparel brand such as Nike and Gucci have be keen to establish the metaverse as a new sale channel however company outside the apparel industry be also create experience for their customer and be show interest in the metaverse meanwhile other company be in a state of anticipation wait to see the outcome of these initial step into the metaverse as the last main section of this literature review the follow section will examine how some of the underlie technology use to build virtual world such as the metaverse this will include some of the basic concept of 3d rendering as well as common design pattern use for the development of virtual space the topic cover in this section will offer an overview of development practice but mainly provide the theoretical background necessary for later practical section at its most basic level virtual world use a real time 3d graphic system which enable user to explore and navigate through virtual space 3d graphic system be use to create a continuous stream of image also know as frame which be update multiple time per second and create the 3d graphic show on the user ’s interface the process of create 3d graphic involve the use of 3 dimensional datum which be transform to be display on a 2 dimensional interface this process be refer to as render and be utilise by real time system which render the 3d graphic in quick succession create an image that seem continuous to the human eye the step involve in the rendering process be know as the 3d pipeline without go into too many intricacy the render pipeline start with vertex as its initial input datum a single vertex be a set of three coordinate which represent a point in a 3 dimensional space by combine three vertex triangle be form and combine lead to the 3d object be interpret as a series of connected triangle the result object be render to the screen through a method know as rasterization rasterization lay a 2d bitmap on top of the 3d object with every tile of the raster mapping to a single pixel the result output of this method be then render to the screen .In term of computing these transformation step require the processor to perform various linear algebra operation such as matrix vector multiplication as rendering be do continuously the computational effort associate with it be high and be thus often outsource to dedicated graphic processing unit GPU while 3d render pipeline be an essential part of display a 3 dimensional environment the application simulate the virtual world be refer to as Realtime Interactive Systems RIS RIS can be use for simulation purpose without the use of 3d rendering however most of they do offer an interface   and common use case include simulate virtual world for the purpose of virtual augment reality or video game simulation manage through RIS consist of entity that populate the virtual space and task or event which in combination with the entity create a virtual narrative similarly Wiebusch and Latoschik describe the virtual environment as datum in the form of the environment 's state which be alter through event create a sequence of change state the result simulation inside the RIS be know as a scene which be manage through a scene graph a tree like data structure that place the scene entity within a hierarchy consist of parent and child node by traverse this scene graph the system know which part of the scene require render example of RIS include game engine such as Unity3D which be mainly use in video game development as well as metaverse application as in other field of software engineering common design pattern and architecture have emerge over time a typical architecture utilise by RIS be the Entity Component System ECS architecture which be commonly utilise in game engine such as Unity3D   as well as metaverse platform such as Decentraland as figure 6 show the ECS architecture fundamentally differentiate between the application 's datum in the form of entity and the system which act on the datum   on the data side component play a critical role as they contain the actual application datum meanwhile entity be initially empty object which can add or remove component as they be need throughout the application 's lifecycle component datum must react to certain event which lead to a change in state in the classical object orient programming paradigm datum and the system act upon it be typically encapsulate together within class however concern datum and its behaviour ECS take a different approach as the system work with and update the datum be implement completely separately from the entity that be influence by the system it should also be note that the algorithm define within the system run continuously once add to the engine in order to mutate the application state a system subscribe to one or multiple component which be then update by the system on each iteration lead to a change in the state of the entity contain these component the ECS approach be a stark contrast to typical object orient design pattern which become especially apparent through its preference for datum composition over inheritance the composition approach be favour since it allow for more flexibility at runtime as component can easily be add or remove it should however be note that system use the ECS architecture be often implement in an object orient language and as such make use of some object orient concept e.g. entity system and component be often define in class and be instantiate as object as show in section 2.2.3 numerous brand be already use the metaverse to create virtual experience for their customer while company could create these experience from the ground up as part of their own virtual world most use exist virtual space with an exist user base such as Roblox Decentraland etc be a platform these service offer metaverse developer an environment in which they can develop and publish their virtual experience which can be explore by the platform ’s user as of today a multitude of these platform exist with popular example be Roblox Decentraland Second Life the Sandbox Spatial and Fortnite while heavily influence by video game the scope of metaverse platform go beyond that of a regular game in that they far combine social network aspect as see in social medium platform and have a virtual economy that often make use of blockchain technology such as nft furthermore the aspect of user creation play a central part in metaverse platform and allow user to create their own virtual asset that range from individual virtual item to entire virtual space such asset be refer to as user generate content UGC and encompas all virtual asset create by the platform ’s user rather than the platform itself through the use of UGC metaverse platform can capitalise on the creativity of its user who supply the platform with new content and in turn help foster the platform 's community the effectiveness and ability to innovate through UGC have be well document in the gaming industry where some of today ’s most popular game such as Counter Strike and Defence of the Ancients 2 be originally develop as UGC for other game by the game user while most video game do not provide any official mean to create UGC metaverse platform which try to promote UGC incorporate various kind of UGC editor such editor provide a toolkit for user to create UGC within the platform and without the need for third party software the editor ’s functionality vary from platform to platform and can mainly be differentiate by the degree of autonomy it allow its user this can be see in UGC editor that allow the upload of external asset versus those that only allow user to use those asset already offer by the platform ugc editor can be find in most of the major metaverse platform Roblox offer its Roblox Studio editor which include a visual editor and script functionality similarly Decentraland offer a basic visual builder tool as well as a software development kit SDK for more advanced content other tool such as the Sandbox ’s Game Maker do not require any programming skill as UGC be a major part of the metaverse experience the editor that provide the user with the tool to create this content represent an integral part of metaverse platform the combination of a virtual world and the tool to construct it have be call an Integrated Virtual World Platform IVWP by Matthew Ball in his book the Metaverse and how it will revolutionize everything   while not an academic source Ball point out how IVWP such as Roblox have immensely simplify building virtual space by offer an accessible abstraction layer on top of the underlying game engine that require limit to no programming skill make these platform increasingly accessible for new user and increase the amount of UGC with the literature review conclude the follow section mark the beginning of the practical section of this thesis as such this section will describe the development and implementation of a white label shopping solution for the metaverse to provide a holistic overview the solution will be explain from various viewpoint start with an overview of the white label solution that will provide some context about the project and explain the business model follow the introduction the focus will switch to the actual implementation of the solution start with the development process and the technology utilise to build the solution subsequently the development process as define will be follow start with the definition of the solution 's requirement and end with an overview of the design artefact use to meet they the development and launch of the white label metaverse solution be conduct parallel to this thesis which be write as part of a three month work placement at the company Worldline Worldline SA be a french CAC 40 list company which specialise in the field of payment technology through its payment platform and product the company accept and process payment on the acquiring as well as issue side of the payment system for customer that require payment acceptance refer to as merchant as well as financial institution that require payment processing the work placement be spend within the Crypto Metaverse Competence Centre a newly found department that handle the implementation business development marketing and communication for Worldline ’s crypto and metaverse related product the department have have previous metaverse experience with its Worldline Showroom a virtual space within the Decentraland platform use to display and promote the Worldline brand and certain solution within the payment industry processor and acceptance provider such as Worldline traditionally operate within the realm of physical in store payment and e commerce while these channel be already be utilise and be characterise by a competitive landscape the metaverse and more specifically v commerce represent a new and unexplored channel with consumer spend more time in virtual space spend in these space have increase as well a 2022 report by McKinsey estimate the daily metaverse trading volume of NFT to be around usd 250 million additionally the metaverse platform Roblox have generate transaction exceed usd 14 billion in 2018 2020 worldline and company like it recognize a significant opportunity to establish v commerce as a third major payment channel in which they can offer payment acceptance solution hence the white label metaverse solution can be see as Worldline 's initial step in establish itself as a major player in the emerge metaverse space and the v commerce channel with regard to the project ’s scope the development of the solution span a two month period that start in January 2023 and which be follow by the launch of the solution in March 2023 throughout this period a project team of four people be involve in the project include the project owner a marketing and communication manager and two developer who be responsible for implement the solution within the software development space a white label product or solution be define as a product that can be rebrande in the look and feel of a customer who can sell it as their own product while create customise version for each customer the solution utilise the same codebase for each rebrande version hence the Worldline white label metaverse offering aim to provide customer with the opportunity to easily set up a metaverse presence and utilise this channel for their sale and advertising purpose to this end the white label solution have take on the shape of a virtual mall comprise individual store which serve as the solution ’s white label component potential customer can lease store space and subsequently rebrand they in accordance with their corporate identity furthermore customer can define various store interior element include the product they would like to display where these should be place and how they should behave upon enter the mall user can view the product display in the store receive information on they and be able to purchase they collectively this solution offer company a quick and uncomplicated mean to establish a metaverse presence and set up a store which will be customise to their need for the launch of the initial solution which be cover in this thesis the virtual mall offer a maximum of 15 store in addition the mall building feature a virtual event space which can be utilise to host as well as live stream event regard the platform user can access the virtual mall on the Decentraland metaverse platform which it be specifically develop for Decentraland be the platform of choice over other popular platform mainly due to its low entry barrier for its user in comparison to other popular platform such as Roblox or the Sandbox Decentraland be one of the only platform that offer a web application that user can access through their browser the platform also offer a downloadable client for user that prefer to use the platform outside the browser additionally user can enter the virtual world as guest without an account while the social functionality be limit for guest user this take away an entry barrier especially for new user furthermore Decentraland be unique in that it be operate almost completely decentralised like many other platform Decentraland have its own cryptocurrency call MANA which be an Ethereum base token that can be use to make purchase within the platform however decentralisation be not limit to the currency the virtual land in Decentraland be represent as a grid of parcel with each parcel represent as an x and y coordinate on the grid amount to a 16x16 metre plot of land in in game unit parcel can be purchase by user use the mana currency ownership of the land as well as other asset be handle through the Ethereum blockchain where the ownership of each parcel be track as a unique token or NFT with their purchase parcel landowner can utilise the land as they please either build their own virtual space or rent the space to other user land rental be support by Decentraland which offer user access to a virtual marketplace where landowner be able to create listing like in real world real estate market price and rental period be decide upon by the owner and be thus influence by supply and demand this lead to parcel in highly frequent region demand high rent and price than those in less frequent region typically those furth from the centre of the virtual world as the virtual mall housing the store be suppose to contain 15 store multiple parcel be require for the solution to accommodate all store eight parcel be need which be rent on the Decentraland marketplace as a plot of 4x2 parcel which amount to a 64x32 metre plot of virtual land the decision to rent versus buy be mainly make due to cost reason as Decentraland Land price can range between 2.490 7.000.000 mana   with a mana to Euro conversion rate of 0.521 at the time of writing while the 4x2 plot be only able to accommodate five store landowner can build vertically to maximise the use of their space thus the mall be conceive as a four floor building with the first three floor contain the white label store and the top floor be utilise as the event space as the business model be a critical aspect of launch a new solution the follow section will focus on various component of the white label metaverse solution which in sum lead to a solution that create value for its customer the most relevant aspect of the solution will be document use select business model building block as define by Osterwalder .With the metaverse establish itself as a new and attractive channel numerous organisation be try to gauge the potential of this channel worldline ’s white label metaverse solution enable its customer to easily build up a metaverse presence where they can offer shopping experience and gauge their customer 's reaction to well understand the channel 's potential within worldline virtual mall customer be quickly able to set up a store which will be customise to fit the company 's look and feel additionally customer can utilise worldline ’s payment capability to accept payment within their store furthermore Worldline can help customer set up target metaverse advertisement as well as phygital AR and VR version of their product the white label solution will be distribute in a business to business context it will target organisation which display interest in the metaverse channel but lack the know how or do not want to make the initial investment require to develop and maintain a virtual experience of their own look at specific industry retail merchant look to establish the v commerce channel be a primary target segment as Worldline can utilise its exist customer relationship from its acceptance business and offer these customer the chance to display their product and accept payment within their virtual space as the solution be target B2B customer distribution of it will primarily take place through direct sale in the form of account management which will place offer with exist account and work to build relationship with new customer online channel such as LinkedIn as well as the Worldline homepage will be use as promotion channel to garner attention and excitement give that the store be be maintain and run in the customer ’s name it be essential to provide each customer with personalized support as each customer will be manage personally the account manager will be their primary contact with which they can discuss change and improvement to their store establish such direct and clear communication channel will help strengthen the customer relationship and help create cross selling opportunity within the white label solution or for other Worldline product the solution will create value for customer through various key activity involve the development and delivery of the solution the development of the solution include the initial design as well as the implementation will be the main value create activity with the base solution develop implement individual store and adjust they to meet the customer expectation will be key furthermore after the first iteration of the solution be complete development on the solution will continue with the aim of implement further improvement and feature from a business perspective it will be essential to formulate and implement a sale strategy along with a marketing plan that include the development of marketing content for multiple channel the solution use a subscription base revenue model in which customer pay a recur fee to gain access to a shop inside the virtual mall the standard subscription plan include a single store that Worldline will implement accord to the client 's preference include the product and advert they want to incorporate however customer have the choice to buy additional add ons the benefit of these add on package include the creation of phygital product that can be utilise in both virtual and physical environment the creation of 3d model replicas of their product and 3d advertisement model for display target ad additionally as Worldline provide the mean of accept fiat currency within the Decentraland platform customer will be charge a transaction fee for each successful purchase the follow section will cover various aspect of the solution development this will include the development process requirement and design artefact that culminate in the final launch product to follow the process in sequential order the section will begin by explain how the development process be structure and discuss the tool and technology that be utilise as part of it subsequently the requirement of the solution will be define follow by a review of the design artefact use to meet each requirement this section will encompass all step of the development from the initial requirement analysis to the launch of the solution the process of implement the solution be split into three main phase start with the initial requirement analysis follow by the implementation of the base solution and lastly the implementation of the individual store as well as the continuous integration and deployment of the solution figure 8 show the individual phase in sequence start from the beginning the identification of functional and non functional requirement be an essential first step in create a blueprint for the implementation of the solution requirement be identify through multiple brainstorm session which include the developer the project manager and other relevant stakeholder the result requirement be document and rank in term of priority and map to one or multiple design artefact while most requirement be define during the initial analysis further requirement be add during the precede implementation phase with the requirement map to individual design artefact the implementation of the base solution be start in term of the duration of the project this phase be the most time consume the design artefact which map to the requirement be use as work package to be implement within weekly sprint artefact be pick with respect to their priority implement and present to the project owner with the base implementation complete the solution meet all of the define functional requirement and be thus in a launch ready state that could be offer to potential customer   the final project phase be split into a pre- and post launch stage in term of activity this phase consist of the implementation of customer shop which be do on an ad hoc basis as customer lease the store space as well as further development and integration of the non functional requirement look at the store implementation the aim be to find nine initial customer which in addition to Worldline 's own store would fill the first 10 store slot of the mall for the launch of the solution with nine initial slot sell the mall be launch onto the live Decentraland server the launch of the solution mark the end of the project as such and the transition to post launch operation which see further integration and modification to the virtual store as well as continuous integration and deployment of feature the technology stack refer to the combination of framework programming language and software tool use to build a piece of software the follow segment will discuss the technology and tool that be most critical in the implementation of the white label solution in term of programming language the solution be entirely write in TypeScript TypeScript be a superset of the JavaScript programming language which be develop and maintain by Microsoft TypeScript be a popular option for JavaScript developer as it add a type system and static type checker to JavaScript make it a statically type language as oppose to a dynamically type language be a superset all valid JavaScript code be also valid TypeScript code make the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript very easy the difference between these two language lie in the fact that TypeScript type be check at compile time as oppose to runtime additionally TypeScript can be strongly type as it be possible to assign variable type while the addition of type require some additional typing effort error within the code be detect without the need to execute it lead to the code contain few undetected bug furthermore the addition of type increase the readability of the code thereby ease future modification TypeScript be choose as it be require by the Decentraland SDK however the static type checking helped prevent many type and spelling error speed up the development time and make for a less frustrating development experience while the platform itself be build on top of the Unity game engine Decentraland require developer to utilise its software development kit SDK to develop for the platform the SDK be a front end framework that allow Decentraland content creator to build virtual scene which can be deploy to the Decentraland platform it require the use of TypeScript and utilise an entity component system architecture with the addition of some basic object orient element in addition to the development framework the SDK include a powerful command line interface CLI which offer developer useful functionality such as the ability to generate the initial project structure preview the scene locally with integrate hot reloading and the option to deploy the scene to test and production environment development for this project use the Decentraland SDK be do within the Visual Studio Code VS Code editor VS Code be the recommend code editor for Decentraland development and offer the official Decentraland Editor extension which can be instal from the VS Code extension tab the editor extension be very useful as it offer a graphical interface for scene deployment and local preview and allow 3d model file to be directly preview from within VS Code Blender be a free and open source 3d computer graphic CG software it provide an extensive 3d creation suite feature 3d creation functionality such as 3d modelling animation render etc which be utilise for the creation of 3d model while Decentraland do not dictate which CG software creator should utilise to create 3d model all 3d model relate documentation use Blender and it be recommend as the platform 's preferred CG tool within the development process Blender be use for 3d modelling 3d animation as well as the editing of exist model due to its extensive feature set Blender have an extremely high learning curve however once a basic level have be reach it be extremely effective in what it do   the tool be especially effective in decrease triangle count of 3d model with its build in Decimate modifier which be often necessary to remain below the scene resource limitation inkscape be a vector graphic editor that be utilise to create and edit vector image as well as other image format like Blender Inkscape be an open source software and completely free of charge the tool be mainly use while implement customer store while customer receive a template state the exact specification many of they supply their marketing material in the wrong format and dimension Inkscape be use to reformat such image to meet the exact requirement while not compromise image quality moreover the tool be use in conjunction with Blender which can utilise vector graphic as the base for 3d model inkscape offer a multitude of option for trace vector image from bitmap use these capability customer marketing material could be import to Blender where it be use to create 3d model lastly while not a technology tool or framework the Decentraland Awesome Repository be an incredibly useful resource that be use throughout the entire development process and should be mention as such the Awesome Repository be a publicly available GitHub repository that be create by the Decentraland DAO and have be maintain and extend by community contributor the repository link to over 50 Decentraland scene which act as example of how common feature can be implement as the Decentraland documentation be rather limited these example scene be an extremely helpful resource during the implementation in addition all asset use in the repository such as 3d model and texture be publicly available many of these be use or modify for the white label solution the follow requirement be define prior to the development of the solution and be define to help with the creation of the design artefact each requirement be map to at least one artefact which be implement in form of a work package while requirement will be explain in this section the implementation of design artefact will be cover in section 3.2.3 requirement be group use the five design requirement category for virtual commerce platform propose by Shen et al .As its most fundamental feature the solution must provide user with a 3d virtual space which they be able to fully explore in order to provide a sense of immersion and an engaging experience user must be able to move freely within this space without be limit to any fix path additionally enter the virtual space must be intuitive and should be do without encounter major entry barrier this should result in a user friendly experience which encourage potential new user to try out the solution as a sense of presence be one of the main determinant for user purchase intention the solution user interface in the form of the virtual mall and its shop should be design interactively and responsively in great detail this mean that the mall and store layout should be design to feel intuitive and be easy to navigate by the user minimise the time spend search for a product in term of the store ’s offering the product on display must look and feel authentic additionally these should allow the user some degree of interactivity and provide responsive feedback add to the 3d authenticity the proposed solution intend to support up to 15 virtual store at the outset however the interface of the solution must be design with the flexibility to expand and accommodate an even large selection of tenant in the future the interface in this case refer to the visual appearance of the mall and the virtual store it showcase the scalability of the solution will become particularly crucial when consider its deployment across various geographical region although the primary focus of the initial launch will be on european customer it be vital that the solution be adaptable and can cater to the demand of other region such as North America Asia or Oceania therefore the interface must provide the flexibility to display relevant virtual store to the user base on their respective region additionally store should be implement in a clean and maintainable manner which support fast adjustment and quick customer onboarding as every Decentraland parcel represent a 3d render scene which require computational resource the platform have define a set of scene limitation which every scene be require to follow the platform have set these limit for performance reason to ensure that the world 's overall performance be not limit by certain scene that require extensive rendering the scene limitation concern multiple 3d resource which be utilise to build the virtual space as well as size constraint for file which be upload to Decentraland ’s content server table 4 provide an overview of the scene limitation set by the platform while some of these resource limit grow with the number of parcel a scene contain certain resource such as material texture and scene height grow logarithmically lead to multi parcel land plot such as the 4x2 plot use for the white label solution see demise return for each additional parcel furthermore as parcel be only count on the two horizontal axis scene with multi floor building such as the mall receive even few resource per building floor since scene that exceed these limit will not be render manage the available resource efficiently be a basic functional requirement the scene 's performance be closely relate to the resource list above that will be utilise in the development process the number of resource a scene utilise and how these be implement greatly influence the performance of the scene in term of the frame per second the user experience have a smooth frame rate be of utmost importance for the solution as it influence usability as well as the immersive experience user experience low frame rate will find it difficult to navigate and interact with the environment which make for a frustrating experience achieve an expectable frame rate be thus a functional requirement while high framer ate that increase the level of immersion will be see as a qualitative requirement it should however be note that measure the success of this requirement will present a challenge as frame rate be very much dependent on the hardware specifically the presence of a GPU that be use to access the virtual space store should be design in a modular manner while each store must be base on the same template canvas all customizable element should be add to the base product as component which can be easily add or remove and customise to the tenant wish component module must be create for the store 's branding product advertisement social medium and video and audio option additionally the store themselves should be implement as self contain module that can easily be move around without any effect on the store ’s interior the use of module should also make for a more scalable solution as modification and addition can be add without the need to rework other section of the codebase while Decentraland allow user to purchase and sell virtual good and land on their platform these transaction can only be make use the platform 's own cryptocurrency mana this will display a problem for most store owner want to sell directly through the platform as accept a cryptocurrency will add a further layer of complexity and risk to the transaction therefore the solution must offer store owner the option of accept regular fiat currency from within their virtual store the integration of the payment acceptance method should be as seamless and convenient as possible and conduct a transaction should not require the user to leave the platform to provide an overview of the solution 's usage and user preference the solution must integrate a method of collect user datum this datum will help provide a thorough understanding of the solution usage and user preference such as the number of user visit the mall and how much time they spend in it as well as the origin of the user furthermore the collect datum should offer insight into user behaviour such as the preferred area and store of the mall these insight will help monitor the solution 's performance in term of usage and provide a well understanding of user preference which will help inform future design decision with the requirement define the subsequent section will focus on the implementation of these as previously state each requirement be map to one or more design artefact which be implement during the implementation phase the follow table provide an overview of all solution requirement which have be cluster use the requirement category propose by Shen et al the right column of the table show each requirement ’s design artefact these artefact will be cover in this section with the focus lie on their implementation and how they meet their matching requirement the virtual shopping mall be the canvas for the entire solution and as such be the first artefact to be implement the mall utilise the 4x2 land plot which be rent on the Decentraland marketplace and provide a 64x32x63 metre area before create the virtual building it be necessary to create a basic structure that could be use as a blueprint for the design and implementation that follow the scene structure be document in the form of a scene graph as figure 9 show the mall building constitute the root element of the scene and contain four direct sub scene in the form of the building ’s floor each floor scene except for the event space contain a total of five store which be the maximum number the land plot could accommodate again each store represent its own sub scene contain the module content specify by the customer with the conceptual layout complete implement the mall building require the 3d modelling of the building concern the modelling it be decide to create individual building component such as the wall floor glass and the roof as oppose to a single building model while this require the component to be individually arrange subsequent change to the building would be easy to make this be make use of to implement multiple operating mode through which the building could quickly be switch from three to four floor depend on customer demand in term of the building look and feel glass material be use on the street phase side allow user to view the store from the outside additionally worldline branding be incorporate into the facade of the building figure 10 show the shopping mall in Decentraland a detailed explanation of the design feature will be give in the follow section and additional picture of the mall exterior and interior be available in the appendix virtual store atmospheric play a crucial role in create a virtual space that offer its user a sense of immersion and presence in order to build an experience which create these sensation multiple pathfinding environmental and product presentation feature be implement to promote the scene atmospheric design these feature will be explain in the follow section environmental atmospheric feature include the space ’s overall theme the use of lighting as well sensory element such as audio or video each of these feature be incorporate into the mall and individual store design start with the overall theme of the virtual mall the aim be to create a modern and visually pleasing look with some futuristic element befit the metaverse thus in term of the building ’s facade glass material be use whenever possible with the addition of wooden material on the building ’s backside and floor in addition neon light strip be utilise to outline the building 's edge give it a distinct look the futuristic theme be far expand upon in the building ’s interior through the use of hover advertisement billboard and teleporter allow the user to instantly move from floor to floor as oppose to stair furthermore lighting be use to distinguish between different space within the building while each floor utilise Decentralands global light source the store ’s interior receive additional light source make for a much bright environment the additional lighting help user view the 3d model within the store as these look more vibrant with additional lighting as store be individually configure content vary from store to store store owner can include product branding advertising social medium as well as audio and video option in their store which could be add in the form of module with each module define a maximum number of configurable element the product presentation feature include all method of show individual product and product information these feature mainly pertain to the product module which be implement to utilise all display option the Decentraland SDK offer hence tenant can choose to display product in the form of 3d model 2d image as well as nfts these product type can vary from product to product allow store to display a combination of they product information be display by hover over the product in form of a short description and by click the product which lead to a specified description page in addition custom component and system be implement to bring product to life and increase 3d authenticity this include the addition of animation system to add rotation as well as vertical and horizontal movement to product likewise scale transition be use in combination with event listener to create hover effect similar to those use in many website to provide additional interactivity and responsiveness to the user ’s action the pathfinding feature include navigational element as well as the layout of both the mall building and the individual store to allow for easy traversal of the scene navigational element be add to each floor this include an overview of the mall at the mall 's entrance show user which store be locate on each floor additionally sign point player to the teleporter be utilise as use these to switch floor level be not as obvious as the use of stair in term of layout store be place in a row of five per floor the linear layout be use due to the space constraint of the scene which would only allow for the store to be place in this fashion meanwhile store allow for more layout option while customer be able to choose the exact layout of their store a standard store layout be propose the standard layout utilise a racetrack approach which allow for a total of seven product four on the outside and three in the middle two advertisement wall a social medium section and a video screen while customer can request other layout option such as a grid or freeform layout this layout be choose as it promote an intuitive store traversal additionally divide product between the centre and outside of the store limit the amount of visual clutter to address the scalability requirement the geo location functionality be add to allow the solution to scale into other geographic region in the future to incorporate this feature the solution must determine the user ’s geographical origin which be base on their IP address and render the mall store that be map to that region or country geo location functionality can easily be integrate through pay and free api service however most free service do not offer encrypt endpoint which be require for all request make from within the Decentraland scene as such the geoPlugin API be choose which offer access to an encrypted api endpoint for a small yearly subscription the api main advantage of this api service be that it can directly scrape the IP address off the sender ’s request whereas other service require the IP to be pass as a request parameter require the use of a further api to find out the user 's IP address the code snippet in figure 10 showcase how the api be utilise within the solution if the region parameter be leave unspecified the api be call to determine the user ’s location deliver a response object which specify the city state country and continent of the request use this information the database be query for the respective region store datum the datum be return by the function and far utilise to render the store for the user at the time of writing geo location specific store be not yet be utilise as there be simply no demand for they at present however should specific region display interest in the future this be an effective measure to easily scale the solution to additional customer additionally user could be give the option of switch to different region after initially be show the store in their region far increase the amount of content the main building include up to four floor with each floor exclude the event space display multiple 3d model and image as such the scene be rather dense in term of content which present a problem due to the scene resource limit set by Decentraland after building and store content be initially implement the scene exceed the triangle material and texture resource limit by more than double mean it could not have be deploy the problem with the initial approach be that all scene content be load and render as soon as the scene be initialise render all content at all time be not necessary since the user only view a fraction of the scene at any give time to alleviate this problem a lazy loading system be implement lazy loading be a common design pattern use to improve application performance by not load content upfront but as it be need the lazy loading functionality have to be implement as the Decentraland SDK do not offer any build in functionality for it however the Decentraland Awesome Repository propose a scene management module through which lazy loading can be utilise   the UML class diagram for the module be show in figure 12 and a complete version of the diagram include class method be available in the appendix the scene management module provide a framework which allow the scene to be divide into multiple sub scene which can be individually manage in term of render this be do through the SubScene class which represent sub scene as invisible box entity refer to as trigger entity or trigger area the baseentitywrapper act as the SubScenes superclass and provide the sub scene trigger entity with an on show event listener which be trigger by user enter the trigger area and the on hide listener that be activate on the user leave the trigger area use these event allow sub scene to be render only when the user see they i.e. when the user enter the trigger area similarly the scene be render invisible on the user leave the trigger area furthermore sub scene can use two lazy load strategy which be specify through a flag within the baseentitywrapper class depend on the choose strategy the sub scene entity be either completely remove from the engine while not visible or be keep in the engine but not render these strategy provide different benefit and make use of the fact that most scene resource limit only apply to entity that be render remove and add scene from the engine will provide the great performance benefit and save the most resource however add the scene back into the engine can be resource intensive alternatively the sub scene can remain in the engine but remain invisible while not be view this strategy also provide performance benefit but not to the extent of the first strategy as the engine still have to manage the scene while it be not be render however keep the sub scene in the engine decrease its loading time in addition to the render strategy sub scene have an on init listener listen to the initialisation of the entire scene make it possible to immediately add sub scene to the engine on initialisation or wait for the user to trigger the scene use this setup give full control over the sub scene lifecycle from the scene ’s initialisation on to all subsequent visit by the user the possibility far increase when consider how these strategy extend to the entity that live within the sub scene the SubScene class can manage entity which upon be add to the sub scene be wrap into an EntityWrapper object as figure 11 show the EntityWrapper class like the SubScene class extend the baseentitywrapper give entity within sub scene access to the render strategy describe above this be very powerful as it allow for some interesting combination of loading and render strategy on the sub scene and entity level utilise this framework each building floor be implement as its own sub scene leave the building ’s facade as the only statically load model the store building locate on the floor would as such only be load and render when user enter the floor the store ’s interior be implement as its own sub scene manage all store content utilise sub scene within sub scene save additional scene resource as model within the store only require render when the user be in view distance additionally 3d model be give different rendering strategy depend on their resource intensity with intricate model be remove from the engine while not visible while small model utilise the invisibility strategy in sum the scene management and the lazy loading it allow reduce the scene resource usage by almost 70 which be crucial in comply with the resource limitation the implementation be a very laborious process as the scene be initially implement without any kind of lazy loading in mind and the integration require fundamental rework developer build resource intensive scene should as such consider integrate this approach from the ground up    at a fundamental level add and position entity in virtual space be a straightforward task however do so without any kind of structure can quickly lead to a cluttered code base that be difficult to maintain and adjust with the scene contain up to 15 store each contain over ten entity it be essential to use a structured approach to manage the scene 's content to this end a modular approach be employ build on the sub scene implementation discuss early content module be define for every configurable aspect of the store result in five module at the time of launch these module include the product branding advertising social medium and media module each module consist of two component the module 's content e.g. product model name animation and description specify in a database document for each store and the script that implement the content share by all store use the module since the same script be use for all store separate these component minimise code duplication as well as the implementation and modification effort with the individual content module implement this approach be far expand to the store level instead of directly add each module to its respective store module be package into a single content package which be set as a child entity of the store entity the store to which a content package correspond be specify in the database this information be then use by the implementation script to add the package to the correct store separate the base store from the content package be an advantageous approach during the implementation of customer store particularly in light of the frequent alteration to the store arrangement typically such rearrangement require the repositioning of all entity present in the store however as content module be bundle as child entity of the store simply adjust the mapping between content package and store within the database cause the implementation script to update the parent entity of the package lead to an automatic repositioning of the store this approach make use of the fact that the position component of parent entity be not overridden by child entity but compound mean that as long as the module content be initially position correctly it will always be position the same no matter which store be set as its parent to enable shop owner to accept fiat currency within their virtual store the solution provide customer with payment link these link can be access by click on a virtual product and select the buy option which open the payment link in a separate tab where the user can enter their datum and confirm the purchase the payment link be create use Worldlines online payment solution Saferpay which be commonly utilise for accept payment in e commerce use case and business application the solution also enable merchant without online shop to include payment link in their invoice which their customer use to pay these payment link have be adopt for use in the metaverse context for shop owner that want to sell directly from their virtual store payment link can be generate with the Saferpay solution allow customer to buy product without exit the platform as with regular Saferpay transaction Worldline will receive a transaction fee for every successful transaction while the aforementioned payment link make it easy for store to accept fiat currency Decentralands officially use the mana cryptocurrency however while mana be its domestic currency there be currently no way to purchase it from within the platform like other cryptocurrencie MANA can be buy on various popular crypto exchange platform which require user to access another platform as this be not an ideal scenario multiple crypto ATMs be integrate into the mall building through these atm user can add the necessary fund to their crypto wallet from within Decentraland the ATMs offer a user interface where user can choose whether they would like to buy or sell currency this lead the user to a form which open in a separate tab where they be able to choose how much mana they would like to buy and with which payment method for user this be an easy way of buy the necessary mana fund which they can spend within the mall or in any other scene within the SDK the atm be represent as custom entity that extend the base entity class and encapsulate business logic and further entity the atm be develop by the company Transak who share the source code with the Worldline team for implementation in order to promote the atm through the launch of the solution in term of user analytic the Decentraland platform offer landowner and operator basic metric while these metric do offer some form of insight they be limit in scope as they only capture weekly user session and the peak number of concurrent user more importantly the datum be refresh weekly without the ability to view the previous week 's statistic to gain additional insight the atlas analytic platform be integrate into the solution the platform be a third party solution which be create from a grant give by the Decentraland DAO and be one of the officially recommend analytic solution scene which integrate atlas analytic receive access to the platform ’s online dashboard where various metric be track over time metric include the number of scene user their geographic origin the percentage of guest versus register user a scene traffic heat map as well as device and browser statistic in addition developer can track specific event within the scene this be utilise to track user movement between the building 's floor as well as how often display product be click at present this platform be free to all Decentraland landowner in term of integration the platform presently do not offer an api or npm package the necessary source code file can be download from the platform 's public gitlab repository and have to be place in the project 's source directory this give developer access to the platform ’s custom component which will track the scene as well as the specify event as mention above while the manual integration without a npm package be not optimal the setup be simple only require basic modification to the custom component after almost two and a half month of development time the white label metaverse solution be launch on the eighth of March 2023 in Decentraland the solution be launch as a three floor building with a total of nine store the follow section will be use to showcase the result include an overview of the customer the solution be able to attract and how these use the content module to configure their store additionally various user statistic will be showcase these result will be follow by a discussion and analysis of the result start with the store owner as mention above a total of nine store be implement at the time of launch which include eight customer store as well as one store operate by Worldline itself this be enough to nearly fill the first two floor of the mall as such the building be launch with three total story as oppose to four with a total of six further store available for rental table 6 provide an overview of the customer rent a store within the mall while customer show a lot of variety regard the industry they operate in in term of company size a majority of the company fall into the small and medium sized enterprise SME category with a median size of 50 employee exclude Worldline look at the company ’s origin all company except for the australian merchant Naked Life have european origin with five of the eight customer originate from either Switzerland or Germany go on to the store customer be give numerous option to configure their store in the form of customizable module table 7 showcase which module be utilise for each store and to which extent the product and medium module be divide into their main option of 3d model image and nft and video and audio respectively to provide a well understanding of which module option be use the most start with the product module 3d model be utilise in all store and be the prefer display option for six out of nine store meanwhile image and nft see less usage with four store not utilise any image for their product nft be only utilise by the company SNGLR which use six of its seven product slot as nfts go on to the medium module customer have the option of add trigger video and audio element to their store this module be utilise by all but three customer who use neither video nor audio element out of the remain six that do use the medium module four store use the video and music option in combination while two include only video with regard to the advertisement module store could make use of two advertisement space that can each rotate four advertisement banner   the module be make use of by all store except SNGLR which choose to utilise this store space for NFTs however while eight out of nine store deploy some kind of advertising only two of these eight utilise more than 50 of their available advertising space with only one store utilise all eight lastly the social medium module be utilise by all customer who use the social element to direct user to their social medium page go beyond the datum in table 7 in term of payment method none of the store utilise payment link to allow user to buy their product from within the virtual store instead they choose to redirect user to the listing of the product on their company ’s website furthermore when it come to store layout all customer use the standard layout propose by Worldline datum on the scene ’s usage be collect use atlas analytic and be collect start with the solution 's launch table 8 provide an overview of the most relevant metric that be collect the datum include the first three week follow the launch of the solution within the first three week the scene be visit by a total of 145 user lead to a weekly average of 48 user most notably user number peak during the launch week and decline in the follow week this also apply to the maximum concurrent user which similarly decline after the initial launch week within the three week user from up to fifteen country visit the scene user visit the space spend an average of nineteen minute within the mall furthermore in term of platform usage the collect data show that user enter as a guest and those enter through their crypto wallet be almost evenly split with an average of 49 and 51 respectively however the datum show a slight trend towards wallet user follow the launch lastly with an overwhelming majority 95 of user access the scene through Decentraland ’s web application while only 5 utilise the client the development and launch of the white label metaverse solution represent a new frontier for Worldline as the solution be the company 's first commercial venture into the metaverse the development of the solution bring with it several unknown while it be discuss which company to target most effectively the lack of precedence leave it unclear which company be interested in this kind of solution and how they would want to utilise the virtual space offer to they the launch of the solution provide valuable datum and insight into the type of customer segment interested in this solution the finding showcase in the previous section suggest that the solution can help non it company which lack the time and know how to develop a solution of their own establish a presence in the metaverse additionally in term of company size the result suggest that sme could be a main target segment which come back to the aspect of limited resource another interesting finding be the lack of in store payment none of the store utilise payment link and opt to redirect customer to their exist payment channel while the lack of in store payment could be down to the transaction fee charge by Worldline it could also indicate that company currently view the metaverse as an advertisement and marketing channel which funnel customer to their more mature sale channel and help create positive publicity by profit off the metaverse hype while brand see value in the white label solution it be unclear whether consumer see any appeal in this kind of virtual experience as suggest by the low user number however the user statistic collect as part of this thesis be too limited to draw any conclusion what the limited datum do suggest be that user who enter the mall be willing to spend considerable time within the mall as suggest by the average time spend in the scene of 19 minute furthermore the total user number be hard to interpret as these statistic be not publicly available as such there be no reference value from other Decentraland scene which could be use as a basis for comparison further research could examine how user statistic develop over time to find out how much consumer demand virtual shopping experience while the launch of the solution be an initial success the focus of this thesis be on the implementation of the solution develop on the Decentraland platform be an enjoyable yet challenging experience the challenge in this project be mainly present due to a lack of prior experience with the platform and more specifically the game development design pattern it utilise while the ECS architecture offer a lot of modularity there be a learn curve for developer accustom to an object orient approach this be not help by the lack of proper documentation for the Decentraland SDK while Decentraland do provide thorough documentation for some aspect of the SDK other be only cover sparingly it be thus highly recommend to make use of all additional resource provide by the Decentraland community such as the Awesome Repository and the Decentraland Discord channel furthermore the challenge associate with create virtual experience also lie in the broad skill set it demand in contrast to mere development a considerable amount of time be dedicate to create and edit 3d model as well as the design of graphic texture use tool such as Blender and Inkscape regard the solution development the process be initiate with a thorough requirement analysis while the majority of requirement could be identify through the analysis and initial test other requirement such as the need for resource management and adjustment to the product module have to be add during the development process scene management in particular be an essential aspect of the solution and enable a more controllable and intelligent allocation of scene resource while originally intend to manage the scene resource it can be expand in the future to manage even more sub scene which can be include in the mall building or swap with the entire mall scene through certain user action in conclusion this bachelor thesis set out with the question of how metaverse platform such as Decentraland can be utilise to create and implement virtual shopping space to tackle this research question a literature review be conduct to establish a solid theoretical understanding of fundamental question concern the metaverse virtual world development concept the emerge v commerce channel and the increase supply of virtual shopping experience while the term metaverse be widely use by many business and platform it currently lack a proper definition with many researcher struggle to agree upon the metaverse 's non negotiable aspect such as the use of VR or the interoperability be virtual world meanwhile many company have invest in the creation of virtual space with the intent to monetize these the creation of such space have be facilitate by virtual platform such as Roblox and Decentraland which lower the entree barrier by offer user integrate content creation tool to address the research question a virtual shopping mall solution be develop for the metaverse platform Decentraland this solution aim to offer customer a virtual white label store which they be able to configure use their branding and the product and advertising element they want to display the design of this solution require an initial requirement analysis which be use to define the immersive technology interface performance intelligence and function requirement of the solution while additional requirement have to be add as development start all requirement be implement within the set timeframe through the implementation process it be find that the aspect of scene resource management and modular design be crucial in build a content rich solution that be nevertheless easy to maintain scale and which adhere to the resource limitation set by Decentraland to provide user visit the mall with a sense of presence numerous atmospheric element be include in the solution design include a modern design with futuristically theme feature navigational element music and video inside store as well as a plethora of product presentation option aim to increase the authenticity and responsiveness of virtual product the implementation be follow by the successful launch of the solution with a total of eight customer rent a store within the mall the initial success of the solution suggest that especially small to medium sized company be interested in such a solution which allow they to quickly set up a shop in the metaverse to explore this new channel however none of the tenant be willing to accept payment from within the platform furthermore limited user statistic imply that consumer who visit the virtual space be willing to spend up to 22 minute within virtual shopping space however in term of user number the initial demand be low with only 145 user visit the mall over the first three week the project thesis on hand Shopping Experiences in the Metaverse implementation of a White Label Metaverse Solution be write during a three month period while work within the Metaverse and Crypto Competence Centre at the company Worldline due to the limited time and scope this thesis be only base on the implementation of the Worldline white label metaverse solution and its launch due to the lack of time only limited datum could be collect follow the launch of the solution go forward further user statistic will be collect to get a well understanding of how many monthly user the solution can attract furthermore the project experience a setback with the loss of one of its developer during the first month of development this loss cause an increase in workload result in the postponement of additional non functional include plan to implement gamification element on the event floor of the mall which would have be cover as part of this thesis I have write the project thesis on hand Shopping Experiences in the Metaverse implement a White Label Metaverse Solution independently and have use no source other than those specify I have indicate the thought adopt directly or indirectly from other source at the appropriate place within the document \""
